## Our setup

odyssey.co.in is a static website. Static sites are much more secure than dynamic sites due to less exposure to the Internet. There is no database and no possibility of making a malicious request. A user can only request files that contain HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc. 

A static site using a CDN like odyssey.co.in is practically immune to attack because if one web server on the network goes down from an attack, many other servers are available to send out the website's pages.

## Cookie Statement
