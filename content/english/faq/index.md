    - faq: "Where is Summertime located?"
      text: "We are located in North Goa, just a few minutes away from bustling Calangute, Candolim and Baga beaches with all their fun restaurants, shops and beaches. We are a little over an hour’s drive away from Goa's Dabolim Airport. A 20-minute drive takes one to either Mapusa or the capital city of Panjim. The beautiful churches of Old Goa are about 45 minutes drive.   
      Summertime is located on a gentle hill just outside the village of Calangute. It is quite a hidden location on a lane with very little traffic, which means peace and privacy for our guests. Of course, when you make a booking with us, we will either give you precise directions or arrange transport for you."
