How does one describe a sunset over the desert, or a sunrise breaking over snow-clad mountains? The soft murmur of ripples against green banks as a rowing boat goes past or the delicate orbs of raindrops as they fall through a forest canopy? Stunning vistas of mountain ranges, rainforests, lazy canals with rowing boats, one of the world's largest coastlines - mile after mile of sandy beaches or smooth sand dunes stretching to the horizon; places that cannot be captured by the best panoramic camera, are all here. What would you like to see?
