Luxury, like beauty, is in the eye of the beholder. For some it may be the mod-cons in opulent surroundings at top dollar, for some others it can be a place to stay with oodles of history, for some, privacy is the clincher.

With its abundant wealth of forts, palaces, heritage homes, delicious culinary offerings and centuries-old service culture, India can offer you a self-indulgent holiday like no other. Whether you're happy to splurge or prefer luxury that doesn't need you to take a mortgage on your home or simply want to weave a special experience or two into your trip we'll make it happen.
