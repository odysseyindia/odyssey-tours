Beyond the cities, India's still a pretty wild country - if you're willing to work those muscles, India offers lots of activities and heart-stopping adventures. Explore the Thar desert on a camel or horse-back, white-water raft on swirling rapids, cruise along rivers, dive or snorkel above coral reefs, explore game parks, or trek in the high mountains. There is something for everyone in India.
