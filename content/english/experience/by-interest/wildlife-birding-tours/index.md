The vast Indian subcontinent goes from snow-clad mountains to deserts to tropical jungles. The wildlife too, therefore, matches the varied habitat. India is the only country where you can see all the three big cats: lions, tigers and leopards. There is an enormous range of other wildlife too, including elephants, deer of all sizes, sturdy bison, sure-footed mountain goats and many more. The birdlife is staggering as well: the resident birds get annual guests from far-away lands, including Siberia!
