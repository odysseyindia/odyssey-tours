India is the birthplace of some of the world's biggest religions: Hinduism, Jainism, Sikhism and Buddhism all came into being here. Islam came to India via the Arab traders who had a flourishing trade with the Malabar Coast, and Christianity came fairly soon after its inception to India, brought here by St Thomas, who is said to have landed in 52 AD at the Malabar Coast in Kerala. Each religion flourishes here and India is therefore the place to learn more about this mystic thing called religion.
