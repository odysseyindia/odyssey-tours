Vardhan is a travel, automotive and food writer, who was editor of BBC Top Gear India and Lonely Planet Magazine India. He moved to Goa to have an easy life, but is currently employed as slave and Man Friday to Hans and Sucheta, with the considerable side benefit of getting to enjoy Summertime when there are no guests.
