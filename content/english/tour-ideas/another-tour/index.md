Another classic adventure in northern India. The journey includes the palaces of Jaipur, the immortal beauty of the Taj Mahal, the medieval temple town of Orchha, the erotic statues of Khajuraho and sunrise over the sacred Ganges. A boat ride on the Ganges at dawn, when it is full of pilgrims making their sin-cleansing dip in the holy river is an amazing experience.

Tour of Old Delhi by Metro and rickshaw

Using the modern Metro and the traditional cycle rickshaw, you visit the magnificent Jama Masjid mosque, India's largest, and the narrow streets of Old Delhi. You then use cycle rickshaws to explore Chandni Chowk, a bustling jumble of craft shops, traders, mosques and temples, and the colourful and aromatic Spice Market. At one end of this street is the huge Red Fort. You can also visit a lovely Sikh Gurdwara.

Drive to Jaipur, the captivating Pink City. On Jaipur's streets, camel carts, scooters, cycle rickshaws, modern cars and bullock carts all jostle for space - a total riot of colour. You may even see a load of computers carried by a camel cart! There are incredible palaces, fascinating observatories, parks and bazaars. Jaipur never fails to thrill.
