          Today, you have a long drive (about 7 hours), but one on which you see
          India unfold from urban roads to highways to smaller towns and finally
          Rajasthan’s villages.


          You end up at Mandawa, a small town in the heart of Rajasthan’s
          Shekhavati area, famous for its painted havelis (mansions). These
          havelis were built in the 19th century by Marwari merchants who
          decorated them lavishly with frescoes, turning them into status
          symbols and homes for their extended families, providing security and
          comfort in style.

          Located on the outskirts of Mandawa and overlooking fields and sand
          dunes, the unique and atmospheric Desert Resort is a truly original
          place to stay. It’s a purpose-built village, with streets leading to
          clusters of huts and thatched pavilions from which to enjoy the
          surroundings. The delightful “mud huts” are surprisingly comfortable,
          with large modern bathrooms, and are brightly decorated with local
          textiles and craftwork. There is an azure swimming pool, and elaborate
          buffet meals are served in the cool dining room, which is decorated
          with shells.

          Starting at the impressive Mandawa Castle, our guide takes you on a
          stroll around the sandy lanes of this small town. Here you will see
          several of the “painted havelis” for which the region of Shekhawati is
          known.


          Built by wealthy Marwari merchants, some of these large family houses
          are now semi-abandoned, others slowly being restored. The paintings
          depict not only religious scenes, but also many different aspects of
          daily life, including several which display the influence of
          Europeans. Often referred to as an “open-air art gallery”, the
          havelis, and other typical architectural features such as wells and
          memorials, are unique to this area.

          An afternoon camel ride to nearby villages is a good way to get to
          know the Shekhawati desert. It is a short but scenic ride and the
          local people are genuinely pleased to see you. It is surprising how
          well populated the desert is, and there is an ever-changing panorama
          of farmland, wells, and villages to be seen amongst the desert scrub
          from your lofty perch on the camel.

          Driving for about 4 hours through the expanse of the Thar desert gets

          The fort is a large 5-storey structure, the surrounding wall of which
          is more than a kilometre in length! Its sumptuously decorated
          interiors are much better preserved than any other fort in Rajasthan.
          The old city retains a medieval air with its maze of narrow lanes and
          some beautifully-carved havelis in red sandstone, and many palaces and
          mansions survive outside the walls.

          memorabilia of Rajput palace life. The different architectural styles

          The massive, turreted Golden Fort dominates Jaisalmer’s skyline and
          the vast surrounding desert. Founded in the 12th century, the fort
          stands on a high hill, enclosed by a thick wall and reinforced with
          bastions. Within these bastions is a complete township of cobbled
          streets strewn with palaces, mansions of rich merchants, and temples.

          evenings.

          Walking through Jaisalmer’s narrow, cobbled lanes provides visitors
          with an extraordinarily medieval feel, unique in modern India. The
          fort itself is not simply a monument, but is home to several thousand
          people. Within it you can see attractive Jain temples and fascinating
          architecture, and enjoy superb views over the city and the desert from
          many vantage points.


          Hidden among the narrow lanes leading off the main market street are
          several magnificent havelis. Patwon Ki Haveli is best known for its
          latticed facade, and Nathmal Haveli has now been converted into a
          small museum of local artefacts. The Gadi Sagar lake is also worth
          seeing for its historic pavilions.

          The best way to experience the Thar Desert that surrounds Jaisalmer is
          on an overnight camel safari. Leaving Jaisalmer in the mid-afternoon,
          you enjoy a half-hour jeep ride, and then board camels for a ride
          lasting approximately two hours through a peaceful, unspoilt area of
          the desert, passing through a mix of scrub, bushes, and sand dunes.


          The camp is set up in a peaceful location close to sand dunes. The
          tents are simple, but all bedding is supplied, and hot water is
          provided for washing. The camp staff prepares dinner and breakfast,
          and the highlight is spending the evening under a blanket of stars.

          taking the jeep back to Jaisalmer. You arrive in the mid-morning back
          at your original hotel, where your luggage has been stored.


          The rest of the day is at leisure to explore this fascinating town on

          excellent museum and affords captivating views of the blue Brahmin
          houses of the old city. The clock tower is a popular landmark in the
          old city. Narrow alleys lead from here to bazaars for textiles, silver

          admire the scope of this architectural feat. The haveli is a maze of
          courtyards, stone stairways, terraces and excellent carvings. The

          Rajasthani aristocratic style.

          Perched on a hilltop dominating the city, Meherangarh Fort is the most
          visually spectacular in Rajasthan. It is approached by a series of
          seven gateways set at an angle to hinder invading armies. Past the
          gates, the fort-palace has huge courtyards surrounded by wings of
          palatial buildings, part of which is now turned into a fabulous
          museum. An excellent audio tour is included in the entrance fee, and
          this leads you through the museum within the Fort.


          Afterwards, it is well worth exploring the ramparts of the fort, with
          their superb views. The Jaswant Thada memorial lies on the approach to
          the Fort, and the large white marble structure is surrounded by the
          cremation grounds of former rulers.

          Today, you have a long drive to Agra, but with some very interesting

          Bharatpur bird sanctuary and the grand folly of Fatehpur Sikri.
          Depending on the stops you make, the drive takes from five hours to
          most of the day.


          Agra is home to possibly the most famous and beautiful building in the
          world: the Taj Mahal, built in the 17th century by the Mughal emperor
          Shah Jahan as a tomb and memorial for his wife Mumtaz Mahal. Along the
          river Yamuna is the impressive Red Fort, the capital of the Mughal
          Empire during the 16th and 17th centuries.
