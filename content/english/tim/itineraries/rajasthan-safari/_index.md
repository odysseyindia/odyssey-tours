          Today, you have a long drive (about 7 hours), but one on which you see
          India unfold from urban roads to highways to smaller towns and finally
          Rajasthan’s villages. You end up at Mandawa, a small town in the heart
          of Rajasthan’s Shekhavati area, famous for its painted havelis
          (mansions). These havelis were built in the 19th century by Marwari
          merchants who decorated them lavishly with frescoes, turning them into
          status symbols and homes for their extended families, providing
          security and comfort in style.

          Located on the outskirts of Mandawa and overlooking fields and sand
          dunes, the unique and atmospheric Desert Resort is a truly original
          place to stay. It’s a purpose-built village, with streets leading to
          clusters of huts and thatched pavilions from which to enjoy the
          surroundings. The delightful “mud huts” are surprisingly comfortable,
          with large modern bathrooms, and are brightly decorated with local
          textiles and craftwork. There is an azure swimming pool, and elaborate
          buffet meals are served in the cool dining room, which is decorated
          with shells.

          Starting at the impressive Mandawa Castle, our guide takes you on a
          stroll around the sandy lanes of this small town. Here you will see
          several of the “painted havelis” for which the region of Shekhawati is
          renowned. Built by wealthy Marwari merchants, some of these large
          family houses are now semi-abandoned, others slowly being restored.
          The paintings depict not only religious scenes, but also many
          different aspects of daily life, including several which display the
          influence of Europeans. Often referred to as an “open-air art
          gallery”, the havelis, and other typical architectural features such
          as wells and memorials, are unique to this area.

          An afternoon camel ride to nearby villages is a good way to get to
          know the Shekhavati desert. It is a short but scenic ride and the
          local people are genuinely pleased to see you. It is surprising how
          well populated the desert is, and there is an ever changing panorama
          of farmland, wells, and villages to be seen amongst the desert scrub
          from your lofty perch on the camel.

          Driving for about 4 hours through the expanse of the Thar desert gets
          you to Bikaner, which grew around the fabulous Junagarh Fort. The fort
          is a large 5-storey structure, the surrounding wall of which is more
          than a kilometre in length! Its sumptuously decorated interiors are
          much better preserved than any other fort in Rajasthan. The old city
          retains a medieval air with its maze of narrow lanes and some
          beautifully-carved havelis in red sandstone, and many palaces and
          mansions survive outside the walls.

          fascinating combination of Indian and European styles with just a few
          large, richly furnished rooms, giving it a hushed, private feel. There
          are grand ceilings, stencils and friezes; the Blue Drawing room is in
          pale blue and gold leaf, the Grand Staircase in a riot of gold - you

          Bikaner. The massive, turreted Golden Fort dominates Jaisalmer’s
          skyline and the vast surrounding desert. Founded in the 12th century,
          the fort stands on a high hill, enclosed by a thick wall and
          reinforced with bastions. Within these bastions is a complete township
          of cobbled streets strewn with palaces, mansions of rich merchants,
          and temples.

          and old paintings and relics. The rooftop Saffron restaurant has fine

          Walking through Jaisalmer’s narrow, cobbled lanes provides visitors
          with an extraordinarily medieval feel, unique in modern India. The
          fort itself is not simply a monument, but is home to several thousand
          people. Within it you can see attractive Jain temples and fascinating
          architecture, and enjoy superb views over the city and the desert from
          many vantage points. Hidden among the narrow lanes leading off the
          main market street are several magnificent havelis. Patwon Ki Haveli
          is best known for its latticed facade, and Nathmal Haveli has now been
          converted into a small museum of local artefacts. The Gadi Sagar lake
          is also worth seeing for its historic pavilions.

          which houses an excellent museum and affords captivating views of the
          blue Brahmin houses of the old city. The clock tower is a popular
          landmark in the old city. Narrow alleys lead from here to bazaars for
          textiles, silver and handicrafts. It’s a fascinating jumble of winding

          Perched on a hilltop dominating the city, Meherangarh Fort is the most
          visually spectacular in Rajasthan. It is approached by a series of
          seven gateways set at an angle so that armies could not charge them
          with any success. Past the gates, the fort-palace has huge courtyards
          surrounded by wings of palatial buildings, part of which is now turned
          into a fabulous museum. An excellent audio tour is included in the
          entrance fee, and this leads you through the museum within the Fort.


          Afterwards it is well worth exploring the ramparts of the fort, with
          their superb views.The Jaswant Thada memorial lies on the approach to
          the Fort, and the large white marble structure is surrounded by the
          cremation grounds of former rulers.

          An old haveli turned into a small, chic guesthouse. Immaculate and
          gleaming in white, the haveli is built around a minuscule courtyard.
          Scalloped arches encircle the verandah restaurant and white walls set
          off a well-chosen collection of artefacts. The 10 tastefully furnished
          rooms are on the upper floors. The rooftop offers great views of the
          Palace complex, the hilltop Taragarh Fort beyond, especially at
          sunset.

          A three-hour drive takes you to Sawai Madhopur, the base for visiting
          beautiful Ranthambhore National Park. The landscape in Ranthambhore is
          more open than in many other parks, making tiger sightings more
          frequent. Other wildlife includes sambhar, nilgai, sloth bear, jackal,
          crocodile, plenty of bird life, and even some leopards.

          This is a 1,000-year-old fort at the periphery of the National Park,
          with a spectacular combination of Rajput and Mughal architecture. From
          the parking area at the base of the fort, a climb of 400 steps winds
          through various gates to a plateau dotted with ruined palaces, tombs,
          and a popular Ganesh temple. There are fabulous views over the park,
          and this is also a great place for birdwatching.

          Today, you have a long drive to Agra, but with some very interesting
          optional stops along the way, at the huge Abhaneri step-well,
          Bharatpur bird sanctuary and the grand folly of Fatehpur Sikri.
          Depending on the stops you make, the drive takes from five hours to
          most of the day.


          Agra is home to possibly the most famous and beautiful building in the
          world: the Taj Mahal, built in the 17th century by the Mughal emperor
          Shah Jahan as a tomb and memorial for his wife Mumtaz Mahal. Along the
          river Yamuna is the impressive Red Fort, the capital of the Mughal
          Empire during the 16th and 17th centuries.

          various vantage points offered throughout the peaceful gardens. Once
          you have taken it all in, you can return to your hotel for a late
          breakfast.
