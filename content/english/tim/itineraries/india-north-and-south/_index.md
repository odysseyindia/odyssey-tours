          Delhi is practically two cities: New Delhi, the capital of India, and
          medieval Old Delhi. The old city centres around the Red Fort, which
          contains opulent palaces and impressive public buildings. Nearby is
          the magnificent Jama Masjid, India’s largest mosque.


          In New Delhi you can find India Gate - a war memorial arch, the
          impressive Parliament Building and Rashtrapati Bhawan, the residence
          of the President. Towards the South are Qutab Minar and Humayun's
          Tomb, both World Heritage Sites.

        title: Morning guided tour of Old Delhi
        content: >-
          When the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan decided to move back from Agra to
          Delhi in 1638, he built within 10 years the huge city of Shah
          Jahanabad, now called Old Delhi, dominated by the Red Fort. The main
          street is Chandni Chowk, a fascinating bustling jumble of craft shops,
          traders, mosques and temples that leads to the magnificent Jama
          Masjid, well worth a visit.


          The rest of your day is at leisure. If you'd like to go shopping or
          explore a bit more after the tour, you can take the Metro to vibrant
          Connaught Place to enjoy the many restaurants and more modern shops.

          A quick, comfortable, early-morning train takes you to Agra, home to
          possibly the most famous and beautiful building in the world: the Taj
          Mahal, built in the 17th century by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan as a
          tomb and memorial for his wife Mumtaz Mahal. Along the river Yamuna is
          the impressive Red Fort, the capital of the Mughal Empire during the
          16th and 17th centuries.

          Agra has much to offer besides the Taj Mahal, such as Agra Fort, a
          masterpiece of design and construction. You then visit
          Itimad-ud-Daulah's tomb - better known as the Baby Taj, which also
          features the same marble inlay work as the Taj Mahal. Finally you will
          visit Mehtab Bagh, a formally laid-out Mughal garden that offers
          stupendous views of the Taj Mahal, especially in the late afternoon.

          This 100-year-old building is testimony to India's long and varied
          history. The low, white colonial building dating back to the Raj era
          is peppered with Mughal paintings and memorabilia, and was host at one
          time to the Crown Princes of England as well as to Mohammad Ali
          Jinnah.


          The wide lawn in the front, and the cupola-marked pool at the back
          complete the feel of a luxury heritage hotel.

        content: >-
          The best time of day to appreciate this stunning monument is as soon
          as the Taj Mahal opens, when it is at its quietest and most serene.
          You can enjoy the gardens, the mausoleum and the mosque, without
          needing a professional guide. Don't miss the marble inlay work and the
          various vantage points offered throughout the peaceful gardens.


          Once you have taken it all in, you can return to your hotel for a late
          breakfast.


          The rest of the day is at leisure to enjoy the pool or further explore
          on your own.

        content: >-
          Today, you have a long drive to Jaipur, but with some very interesting
          optional stops along the way, at the grand folly of Fatehpur Sikri,
          Bharatpur bird sanctuary, and the huge Abhaneri step-well. Depending
          on the stops you make, the drive takes from five hours to most of the
          day.


          Jaipur is one of the most interesting cities in India, with exuberant
          18th- and 19th-century palaces and exotic street life. Just outside
          town is the impressive Amber Fort. It is worthwhile spending time
          wandering through the bazaars. Jaipur is well known for its beautiful
          carpets, enameled ornaments, precious and semi-precious stones, brass
          ornaments and many other arts and crafts.

          Just off a busy street near the old walled city, Alsisar Haveli offers
          peace and serenity once you step through the arched gateway. Most of
          the aristocratic families, loyal to the royal house of Jaipur,
          maintained lavish town-houses in Jaipur. Alsisar Haveli is one such
          property. The current head of the family has sympathetically restored
          the old haveli, which now has a lovely swimming pool in a large,
          peaceful garden.

          To experience the life of the Pink City beyond the monuments, it is
          best to join a guided morning walk. Starting in the heart of the Old
          City, you will walk along the busy main streets, lined with parades of
          traditional shops, and explore smaller side streets, each devoted to
          different crafts.


          You will see various tradesmen, such as marble-sculptors and
          bangle-makers at work, visit local temples, see the colourful
          vegetable and flower markets, and sample delicious street foods, such
          as jalebis, rabri, kachoris, and lassi.

          courtyard, which leads to a magnificent complex of palaces, halls,
          pavilions, gardens and temples built over 125 years. There are
          excellent views down over the old town of Amer, and up to the Jaigarh
          and Nahargarh Forts higher in the hills.

          A flight takes you to the other end of India, to lush, pretty Kerala.
          Kochi (or Cochin) is set on a cluster of islands and narrow peninsulas
          and has one of the best natural harbours in the world. The famed
          'Malabar Spices' were exported from this very port, bringing to Kochi
          visitors as varied as the Arabs, the Dutch, the Portuguese and,
          finally, the British. All of them have left their mark on the
          architecture, making Kochi one of the most unique and fascinating
          towns in India.


          The evening is free for you to just enjoy the waterfront and stroll
          around the lovely lanes, under the shade of spreading rain trees.

          Harbour Hotel enjoys a superb location.


          The Old Harbour Hotel has characterful rooms, nooks and corridors
          dotted with antiques, and a beautiful poolside area in the shade of
          huge rain trees, perfect for relaxing with a beer.

          At the entrance of Kochi harbour, the Chinese fishing nets are
          fascinating. A short walk away is St Francis Church, built by the
          Portuguese in 1510. Vasco da Gama, who died in 1524, was buried here.


          Also in Fort Kochi is a 17th-century Jewish synagogue. Scrolls of the
          Old Testament and copper plates inscribed in Hebrew are preserved
          here. There is also the 'Dutch' Palace, built by the Portuguese for
          the Raja of Cochin in 1555.

          from the Puranas and the Mahabharata - superhuman beings, demons, and
          ordinary men and women.


          The dancers, all males, adorn themselves in huge skirts and headdress,
          wearing what must surely be the most intricate make-up of any dance
          style in the world.

          nutmeg, pepper, cinnamon or cardamom.


          Learn about the medicinal and culinary uses of these spices, and about
          the geographical and climatic peculiarities of Thekkady such as the
          cool climate and its elevation above sea level, which make it ideal
          for spice cultivation.


          The afternoon is free for you to decide what you’d like to do: go on a
          boat trip, relax, or go birding around your hotel.
