          Today, you drive to Jaipur, which takes about five hours along a good,
          if busy, highway, with time to just relax afterwards.


          The capital of the state of Rajasthan is one of the most interesting
          cities in India, with exuberant 18th- and 19th-century palaces and
          exotic street life. Just outside town is the impressive Amber Fort. It
          is worthwhile spending time wandering through the bazaars. Jaipur is
          well known for its beautiful carpets, enameled ornaments, precious and
          semi-precious stones, brass ornaments and many other arts and crafts.

          Jaipur as you cycle through the narrow alleys to get a peek into
          homes, kitchens and workshops. You learn about the lives of the locals
          and the history of the city, and visit the colourful and bustling
          vegetable and flower markets. You will also enjoy a traditional

          You will meet your guide directly after the cycling tour, who will
          accompany you to Amber Fort, just to the north of Jaipur. There is a
          short, steep walk up to the entrance courtyard, which leads to a
          magnificent complex of palaces, halls, pavilions, gardens and temples
          built over 125 years. There are excellent views down over the old town
          of Amer, and up to the Jaigarh and Nahargarh Forts higher in the
          hills.


          The rest of your day is at leisure to explore Jaipur’s lovely markets
          on your own.

        title: Agra
        content: >-
          Today, you have a long drive to Agra, but with some very interesting
          optional stops along the way, at the huge Abhaneri step-well,
          Bharatpur bird sanctuary and the grand folly of Fatehpur Sikri.
          Depending on the stops you make, the drive takes from five hours to
          most of the day.


          Agra is home to possibly the most famous and beautiful building in the
          world: the Taj Mahal, built in the 17th century by the Mughal emperor
          Shah Jahan as a tomb and memorial for his wife Mumtaz Mahal. Along the
          river Yamuna is the impressive Red Fort, the capital of the Mughal
          Empire during the 16th and 17th centuries.

          Today, you drive back to Delhi along the Yamuna Expressway, which
          should take about 4 hours. The rest of your day is at leisure, to
          either rest or to explore on your own.


          Delhi is practically two cities: New Delhi, the capital of India, and
          medieval Old Delhi. The old city centres around the Red Fort, which
          contains opulent palaces and impressive public buildings. Nearby is
          the magnificent Jama Masjid, India’s largest mosque. In New Delhi you
          can find India Gate - a war memorial arch, the impressive Parliament
          Building and Rashtrapati Bhawan, the residence of the President.
          Towards the South are Qutab Minar and Humayun’s Tomb, both World
          Heritage Sites.

        title: Morning guided tour of Old Delhi by Metro & rickshaw
        content: >-
          A half-day tour to Old Delhi using the modern Metro and the
          traditional cycle rickshaw. The Metro brings you to the heart of Old
          Delhi in just a few minutes, to visit the magnificent Jama Masjid
          mosque, India’s largest. You then use walk and ride cycle rickshaws
          through the fascinating maze of narrow streets around the main street
          of Old Delhi, Chandni Chowk, a bustling jumble of craft shops,
          traders, mosques and temples.


          At one end of this street is the huge Red Fort, the symbol of Delhi,
          which contains within it palaces and impressive public buildings.
          (Please note, though, that we will not go inside the Red Fort, because
          on this tour we concentrate on the narrow alleys and atmosphere of Old
          Delhi. However, you could arrange with your local guide to see the Red
          Fort at the end of your half-day tour). At the other end of Chandni
          Chowk is the colourful and aromatic Spice Market, the roof of which
          offers great views over Old Delhi. You can also visit the bustling and
          colourful Sikh Gurdwara.


          The rest of your day is at leisure. If you’d like to go shopping or
          explore a bit more after the tour, you can take the Metro to vibrant
          Connaught Place to enjoy the many restaurants and more modern shops.
