          You start this extension tour by driving to Manebhanjang, the little
          gateway town for Singalila National Park.


          Singalila is one of the most exotic Himalayan forests in India,
          located on the Singalila Ridge at an altitude of 7,000-12,000 feet
          above sea level. It is one of the best places in India to see the
          elusive red panda. Among some of the rarest mammals in the world, the
          red panda thrives in forested regions harbouring dense bamboo
          undergrowth which their favourite food.


          At Manebhanjang, you get into historic Land Rovers (very Tomb Raider!)
          and drive for around 2.5 hours to your forest hideaway; these
          70-year-old vehicles make your journey fun and interesting as you make
          your way through rhododendron copses to Habre’s Nest.

          Right on the Indian-Nepalese border, Habre’s Nest is a quaint homestay
          perched on the Singalila ridge at 2,900m. It is a small, intimate
          lodge with just four double rooms, and although remote, it still
          provides the amenities needed for a comfortable stay.


          Named after the Nepalese word for red panda, Habre’s Nest is a
          research hub to help protect the red panda and its habitat. As part of
          their conservation efforts, they also aim to educate their guests
          about the red panda, benefit the local community by employing local
          people and contribute 20 percent of the profits to conservation.

          During your stay first preference is given to red panda sightings and
          you are therefore asked to stay close to Habre’s Nest. All the
          trackers will be out looking for the red panda during daylight with
          necessary breaks. In case of sightings, you will start your journey
          with all the necessary field support.


          In the meantime, you can enjoy bird sightings close to the lodge, and
          wait for the call. You can also use the in-house bird studio for
          staying hidden and watching or documenting elusive Himalayan wildlife.
          This bird hide hosted 45-50 different species over the years.


          The afternoon is generally affected by bad weather so depending on the
          situation you can choose what’s best to do.

          Today is another opportunity to follow the trail of a red panda,
          accompanied by an experienced wildlife tracker.


          Enjoy the early morning views of the enchanting Himalayas with a cup
          of morning tea and afterwards try to get a glimpse of the many Eastern
          Himalayan birds - including red-billed leiothrix, chestnut-headed
          tesia and blood pheasant. Mammals that you may spot include Himalayan
          black bear, muntjac deer, pangolin, wild boar and, not very often,
          leopard.


          All the while you wait for a call from the trackers to join them for a
          red panda sighting!

In one of India’s most hidden national parks lurks the red panda, a small, endangered bundle of cuteness. Getting on this little predator’s trail means going to Singalila National Park, not far from Darjeeling on the border of India and Nepal, and staying at a forest lodge dedicated to the habre, as the red panda is called in Nepali. This four-day extension can be added to any tour, and gives you time to track the red panda, to spot Himalayan birds, black bears, even the critically endangered pangolin, all with gorgeous views of the Eastern Himalayas.
