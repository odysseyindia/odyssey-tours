          Delhi is practically two cities: New Delhi, the capital of India, and
          medieval Old Delhi. The old city centres around the Red Fort, which
          contains opulent palaces and impressive public buildings. Nearby is
          the magnificent Jama Masjid, India’s largest mosque. In New Delhi you
          can find India Gate - a war memorial arch, the impressive Parliament
          Building and Rashtrapati Bhawan, the residence of the President.
          Towards the South are Qutab Minar and Humayun’s Tomb, both World
          Heritage Sites.

        title: Morning guided tour of Old Delhi by Metro & rickshaw
        content: >-
          A half-day tour to Old Delhi using the modern Metro and the
          traditional cycle rickshaw. The Metro brings you to the heart of Old
          Delhi in just a few minutes, to visit the magnificent Jama Masjid
          mosque, India’s largest. You then use walk and ride cycle rickshaws
          through the fascinating maze of narrow streets around the main street
          of Old Delhi, Chandni Chowk, a bustling jumble of craft shops,
          traders, mosques and temples.


          At one end of this street is the huge Red Fort, the symbol of Delhi,
          which contains within it palaces and impressive public buildings.
          (Please note, though, that we will not go inside the Red Fort, because
          on this tour we concentrate on the narrow alleys and atmosphere of Old
          Delhi. However, you could arrange with your local guide to see the Red
          Fort at the end of your half-day tour). At the other end of Chandni
          Chowk is the colourful and aromatic Spice Market, the roof of which
          offers great views over Old Delhi. You can also visit the bustling and
          colourful Sikh Gurdwara.


          The rest of your day is at leisure. If you’d like to go shopping or
          explore a bit more after the tour, you can take the Metro to vibrant
          Connaught Place to enjoy the many restaurants and more modern shops.

          A quick, comfortable, early-morning train takes you to Agra, home to
          possibly the most famous and beautiful building in the world: the Taj
          Mahal, built in the 17th century by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan as a
          tomb and memorial for his wife Mumtaz Mahal. Along the river Yamuna is
          the impressive Red Fort, the capital of the Mughal Empire during the
          16th and 17th centuries.

        content: >-
          The Taj Mahal is one of the most fascinating and beautiful monuments
          in the world. About 20,000 workers were employed in its construction,
          which took some 20 years. Agra’s Red Fort, built in the form of a half
          moon on the Yamuna river, is a masterpiece of design. The fort’s
          colossal walls are encircled by a moat and contain a maze of
          buildings, that form a small city within a city. You visit both on a
          half-day guided tour.

          This 100-year-old building is testimony to India’s long and varied
          history. The low, white colonial building dating back to the Raj era
          is peppered with Mughal paintings and memorabilia, and was host at one
          time to the Crown Princes of England as well as to Mohammad Ali
          Jinnah. The wide lawn in the front, and the cupola-marked pool at the
          back complete the feel of a luxury heritage hotel.

        content: >-
          Today, you have a long drive to Jaipur, but with some very interesting
          optional stops along the way, at the grand folly of Fatehpur Sikri,
          Bharatpur bird sanctuary, and the huge Abhaneri step-well. Depending
          on the stops you make, the drive takes from five hours to most of the
          day.


          Jaipur is one of the most interesting cities in India, with exuberant
          18th- and 19th-century palaces and exotic street life. Just outside
          town is the impressive Amber Fort. It is worthwhile spending time
          wandering through the bazaars. Jaipur is well known for its beautiful
          carpets, enameled ornaments, precious and semi-precious stones, brass
          ornaments and many other arts and crafts.

          Just off a busy street near the old walled city, Alsisar Haveli offers
          peace and serenity once you step through the arched gateway. Most of
          the aristocratic families, loyal to the royal house of Jaipur,
          maintained lavish town-houses in Jaipur. Alsisar Haveli is one such
          property. The current head of the family has sympathetically restored
          the old haveli, which now has a lovely swimming pool in a large,
          peaceful garden.

          To experience the life of the Pink City beyond the monuments, it is
          best to join a guided morning walk. Starting in the heart of the Old
          City, you will walk along the busy main streets, lined with parades of
          traditional shops, and explore smaller side streets, each devoted to
          different crafts.


          You will see various tradesmen, such as marble-sculptors and
          bangle-makers at work, visit local temples, see the colourful
          vegetable and flower markets, and sample delicious street foods, such
          as jalebis, rabri, kachoris, and lassi.

          Just to the north of Jaipur, Amber Fort overlooks the city from a spur
          of the Aravalli Hills. There is a short, steep walk up to the entrance
          courtyard, which leads to a magnificent complex of palaces, halls,
          pavilions, gardens and temples built over 125 years. There are
          excellent views down over the old town of Amer, and up to the Jaigarh
          and Nahargarh Forts higher in the hills.

          The holy (and hippie) city of Pushkar clings to the side of beautiful
          Pushkar Lake, a three-hour drive from Jaipur.


          You have a free afternoon to explore the city on your own: hundreds of
          small temples are built on the periphery of the lake with wide stone
          steps or ‘ghats’ leading down to the lake, and streets full of gem
          shops, souvenir stalls and street-food vendors just behind. A magical
          quality of light hovers over the lake, bouncing off the surrounding
          white-washed temples and bathing ghats. At sunset, Pushkar turns into
          one of the most exotic places on earth.

          former palace of the Maharaja of Kishangarh has green gardens and the
          verandahs overlooking the lake, temples and ghats. The hotel’s owner
          is a great collector of antique furniture, and all rooms have
          hand-picked features. Large armoires with cut-glass handles, carved
          mirror frames, and other smaller pieces of colonial or Rajasthani
          furniture are a delight.

          A four-hour drive from Pushkar is the small village of Chandelao with
          its 300-year-old fort. Here you can interact with the local community
          and learn about the art, culture and heritage of Rajasthan. This is
          also one of the best places to witness traditional village life - an

          there are many migratory birds, and deer and peacocks can be seen, as
          well as blackbuck and nilgai. You will see local women in traditional
          attire fetching water from the wells, and gain an insight into
          traditional Indian village life – and take part in a traditional opium
          ceremony!

          village women. The rooms are traditional yet comfortable, and the food

          The heart of the Thar desert, Jaisalmer, is a six-hour drive from

          The massive, turreted Golden Fort dominates Jaisalmer’s skyline and
          the vast surrounding desert. Founded in the 12th century, the fort
          stands on a high hill, enclosed by a thick wall and reinforced with
          bastions. Within these bastions is a complete township of cobbled
          streets strewn with palaces, mansions of rich merchants, and temples.

          they are all full of character, furnished with lovely carved furniture
          and old paintings and relics. The rooftop Saffron restaurant has fine

          evenings.

          Walking through Jaisalmer’s narrow, cobbled lanes provides visitors
          with an extraordinarily medieval feel, unique in modern India. The
          fort itself is not simply a monument, but is home to several thousand
          people. Within it you can see attractive Jain temples and fascinating
          architecture, and enjoy superb views over the city and the desert from
          many vantage points.


          Hidden among the narrow lanes leading off the main market street are
          several magnificent havelis. Patwon Ki Haveli is best known for its
          latticed facade, and Nathmal Haveli has now been converted into a
          small museum of local artefacts. The Gadi Sagar lake is also worth
          seeing for its historic pavilions.

          The best way to experience the Thar Desert that surrounds Jaisalmer is
          on an overnight camel safari. Leaving Jaisalmer in the mid-afternoon,
          you enjoy a half-hour jeep ride, and then board camels for a ride
          lasting approximately two hours through a peaceful, unspoilt area of
          the desert, passing through a mix of scrub, bushes, and sand dunes.


          The camp is set up in a peaceful location close to sand dunes. The
          tents are simple, but all bedding is supplied, and hot water is
          provided for washing. The camp staff prepares dinner and breakfast,
          and the highlight is spending the evening under a blanket of stars.

          blue Brahmin houses of the old city.


          The clock tower is a popular landmark in the old city. Narrow alleys

          Perched on a hilltop dominating the city, Meherangarh Fort is the most
          visually spectacular in Rajasthan. It is approached by a series of
          seven gateways set at an angle to hinder invading armies. Past the
          gates, the fort-palace has huge courtyards surrounded by wings of
          palatial buildings, part of which is now turned into a fabulous
          museum. An excellent audio tour is included in the entrance fee, and
          this leads you through the museum within the Fort.


          Afterwards, it is well worth exploring the ramparts of the fort, with
          their superb views. The Jaswant Thada memorial lies on the approach to
          the Fort, and the large white marble structure is surrounded by the
          cremation grounds of former rulers.

          beautiful, lamp-lit step-well dinner, a must for a romantic stay. You
          can also go horse-riding, trekking or on a leopard safari; all these
          activities can be booked directly at the hotel.

        content: >-
          Each morning, a staff member from Rawla Narlai accompanies guests on a
          walk through the surrounding village. Narlai is a very close-knit
          community, and people still live in a traditional way. During the walk
          you can go inside some of the village houses, meet the local people,
          and find out more about their lives.


          After your walk, you drive through the hills of southern Rajasthan,
          visiting the beautiful complex of marble temples at Ranakpur, and
          amazing Kumbhalgarh Fort, home to the second-longest wall in the world
          after China.

          You end the day in lovely Udaipur. Set around the vast Pichola Lake
          and dominated by dramatic palaces, Udaipur is surely Rajasthan’s most
          picturesque city. High whitewashed houses and narrow, winding alleys
          lend it an almost medieval charm. The huge City Palace, still the
          residence of the Maharana, is carved out of yellow sandstone and
          stands on the banks of Lake Pichola, from where you have fabulous
          views over the lake and the famous Lake Palace Hotel.

          A delightful 17th-century haveli, right on the banks of Lake Pichola.
          The whitewashed walls and plants create an atmosphere of pure
          relaxation and tranquility in this otherwise busy area. The rooms
          differ in size and decor, but are all attractive, with local fabrics
          and antique furniture. Most do not have lake views, but the many
          terraces, the rooftop pool and the restaurant all have excellent views
          of Lake Pichola.

          The highlight of this guided city tour is a visit to the City Palace,
          now largely preserved as a museum with a large and varied collection
          of mosaics, glass and porcelain figures, miniatures and paintings.
          There are superb views over Lake Pichola and the Lake Palace Hotel.
          Nearby is the 17th-century Jagdish temple, famous for its superb and
          distinctive architecture and a centre of constant activity.


          The city tour is followed by a relaxing, hour-long (shared) motor boat
          ride on the lake, with views of the activity on the “ghats” used by
          local people for washing and bathing, the City Palace complex, and the
          Aravalli Hills to the west. You also pass the famous luxury Lake
          Palace hotel, and stop to visit the serene “pleasure island” of Jag
          Mandir.
