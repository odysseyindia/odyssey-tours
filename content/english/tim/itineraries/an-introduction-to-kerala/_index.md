        content: >-
          Kochi (or Cochin) is set on a cluster of islands and narrow peninsulas
          and has one of the best natural harbours in the world. The famed
          ‘Malabar Spices’ were exported from this very port, bringing to Kochi
          visitors as varied as the Arabs, the Dutch, the Portuguese and,
          finally, the British. All of them have left their mark on the
          architecture, making Kochi one of the most unique and fascinating
          towns in India.

          The Fort House is one of the older establishments on the waterfront of
          Fort Cochin. This atmospheric property has undergone extensive
          renovation and now offers over twenty pleasant rooms. The restaurant
          on the waterfront is a big draw - not just for its location, but also
          its seafood specialties. Tourists as well as Kochi residents are
          regular visitors here, and they come to enjoy the evening views of the
          harbour.

        content: >-
          At the entrance of Kochi harbour, the Chinese fishing nets are
          fascinating. A short walk away is St Francis Church, built by the
          Portuguese in 1510. Vasco da Gama, who died in 1524, was buried here.
          Also in Fort Kochi is a 17th-century Jewish synagogue. Scrolls of the
          Old Testament and copper plates inscribed in Hebrew are preserved
          here. There is also the ‘Dutch’ Palace, built by the Portuguese for
          the Raja of Cochin in 1555.

          This evening, you get to catch an evening performance of kathakali and
          other dances from Kerala. In kathakali, the actors depict characters
          from the Puranas and the Mahabharata - superhuman beings, demons, and
          ordinary men and women. The dancers, all males, adorn themselves in
          huge skirts and headdress, wearing what must surely be the most
          intricate make-up of any dance style in the world.

        title: Nature walk in Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary
        content: >-
          Different nature trails traversing diverse habitats form the trekking
          routes, generally 4 to 5km in length. This nature walk offers an
          excellent opportunity to watch birds, butterflies and other wildlife.
          The trails often pass through evergreen and moist deciduous forests
          interspersed with marshy grasslands. Note: The program either starts
          at 7 am or 2.30pm and lasts for about 2.5 hours. Children of only 13
          years and above are allowed to participate in the above programs. A
          maximum of 6 persons can go trekking at a time along each nature
          trail, accompanied by the trained tribal guide.

          As you take a walk along the winding pathways among the plantations,
          the thing that strikes you first is the lingering aroma, of cloves,
          nutmeg, pepper, cinnamon or cardamom. Learn about the medicinal and
          culinary uses of these spices, and about the geographical and climatic
          peculiarities of Thekkady such as the cool climate and its elevation
          above sea level, which make it ideal for spice cultivation.

          Today, your four-hour drive takes you to Kerala’s picture-postcard
          backwaters, and for a very special stay. Alleppey (also called
          Allapuzha) is a bustling town south of Kochi, and a major trading
          centre for the coir industry. It is also the centre of Kerala’s
          backwaters, with many interesting homestays in nearby villages.
          Caressed by the Arabian Sea and with a vast network of lakes, lagoons
          and rivers, this region shelters some unique animal and birdlife.

        content: >-
          One of the most tranquil and relaxing things you can do in India is to
          cruise through the backwaters in a Kerala houseboat, known as a
          kettuvallam. There is an open sitting area where you can relax and
          watch the world go by, sipping from a tender coconut and enjoying the
          sheer peace of the surroundings. Freshly cooked Indian food and
          chilled beer make the experience even more enjoyable.

          traditions. Time can be spent watching the toddy tappers climbing the
          tall trees, walking among the paddy fields or along the river banks,
          or rowing through the narrow canals in a country boat.

        content: >-
          A short drive away, Mararikulam (generally shortened to Marari) offers
          one of the most fabulous stretches of soft sandy beach, fringed with
          swaying palms. In the village, life still goes on much as it did a
          hundred years ago, with the men going out to sea each day to earn a
          living bringing in the daily catch. It is an idyllic retreat for those
          who want to “get away from it all”.


          You have two full days to simply enjoy the beach, and perhaps explore
          the village on foot or by bicycle.

          restaurant with good-value food. There is direct access onto the
          beach, which is cleaned and patrolled by the resort’s own lifeguards.
