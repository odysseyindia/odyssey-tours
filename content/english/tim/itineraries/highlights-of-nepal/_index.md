          traditionally Newari-style wooden decor, which gives it plenty of
          charm. The rooms are spacious, combining contemporary facilities with
          wood-clad beams and red tiles for an attractive ambience, and there is
          a top-floor lounge and bar, and an Asian fusion restaurant. A very
          easy-to-like option in Kathmandu.

          You will never forget your first view of the Annapurna range of the
          Himalayas from Pokhara. The stunning Macchapucchare, also known as
          “Fishtail Mountain”, seems almost close enough to touch, and behind it
          loom the many peaks of the Annapurnas, several of them amongst the
          highest mountains in the world. Pokahara has a relaxed atmosphere,
          conducive to easy strolls and cups of tea by the lake, and enjoying
          the stunning views.

          “Machhapuchre” (Fish Tail), and their reflection on the lake. Built in
          the 1960s, it has hosted royalty and world leaders, and though a
          little faded now, it still offers a charming, unique stay with
          comfortable rooms and its terrific location.

        content: >-
          The World Peace Pagoda is a massive Buddhist stupa set on top of a
          hill by Pokhara’s Phewa Lake. You visit this impressive temple, built
          after the Second World War by a Japanese Buddhist monk, sickened by
          the violence he had seen. After your visit, you’re at leisure to just
          relax, or to visit Pokhara’s cheerful, colourful bazaar and to explore
          the lake. There are many boats on the lake, and you can hire one to
          sail or row to the island temple in the middle of the water.

          Nepal conjures up images of snowy mountains, but it also has the
          terai, a grassy region of lower-lying plains. In the middle of these
          is the lovely Chitwan National Park, a great place to look for the
          endangered one-horned rhino, tigers, birds and plenty of other
          wildlife in varying landscapes. Its waterways even contain the rare
          Gangetic dolphin, so this is a fabulous spot for anyone who enjoys
          being out in the wild.

          A unique hotel at Chitwan national park, which, amazingly, has its own

          NGO, it employs people from the local Tharu tribe, grows its own
          vegetables, and uses solar power. The rooms are simple but cheerful
          and brightly coloured, and there is a lovely open-air terrace and a
          flower garden, from where you can watch the resident elephants. A fun
          choice in Chitwan.

Starting in the capital, Kathmandu, you have time to explore its narrow streets, lovely medieval architecture and hidden temples. You continue to Pokhara, famous for its fabulous Himalayan views and beautiful lake, and then on to Chitwan National Park, with its abundant wildlife, especially the rare one-horned rhinos.

A perfect trip either on its own or combined with India.
