          Kochi (or Cochin) is set on a cluster of islands and narrow peninsulas
          and has one of the best natural harbours in the world. The famed
          ‘Malabar Spices’ were exported from this very port, bringing to Kochi
          visitors as varied as the Arabs, the Dutch, the Portuguese and,
          finally, the British. All of them have left their mark on the
          architecture, making Kochi one of the most unique and fascinating
          towns in India.

          Old Testament and copper plates inscribed in Hebrew are preserved
          here. There is also the ‘Dutch’ Palace, built by the Portuguese for
          the Raja of Cochin in 1555.

          The dancers, all males, adorn themselves in huge skirts and headdress,
          wearing what must surely be the most intricate make-up of any dance

          After breakfast, drive right into the Western Ghats, a hill range

          Munnar. Sprawling tea plantations, picture-book towns with old
          Raj-style bungalows, winding lanes and cool air make Munnar the
          perfect place for a relaxed holiday.


          Munnar also has the highest peak in South India, Anaimudi. Here you
          also find the Eravikulam/Rajamalai National Park, the last stronghold
          of the world’s rarest mountain goat, the Nilgiri tahr.


          The rest of your day is at leisure to explore the plantation and walks

          To get up close to some of the world’s last Nilgiri tahr (a variety of
          mountain goat or ibex), visit nearby Eravikulam National Park.
          Existing only in the mountain grasslands of the Western Ghats at
          altitudes above 2,000m (6,400 ft), the tahr is as endangered as the
          tiger. You walk along an often-foggy road lined, with easy sightings:
          the tahrs have grown so used to visitors that you can get within a few
          yards of them.


          Tata Tea recently opened a Tea Museum at the Nallathanni Estate of
          Tata Tea in Munnar which houses curios, photographs and machinery,
          each depicting a turning point that contributed to a flourishing tea
          industry, as seen today in the region. You can visit this museum after
          descending from Eravikulam.

          Learn about the medicinal and culinary uses of these spices, and about
          the geographical and climatic peculiarities of Thekkady such as the
          cool climate and its elevation above sea level, which make it ideal

          cool, inviting Ooty. Originally a Toda tribal village, Ooty (or
          Udhagamandalam) was established as a hill resort by the British in the
          19th century. It has a lingering touch of the Raj in the English
          cottages, clubs, boarding schools and churches.


          Ooty is spread over a large area amongst rolling hills and valleys,
          with a lovely lake and racecourse. There are also Botanical Gardens
          here with immaculate lawns housing hundreds of varieties of plants.

          The best place to stay in Ooty. High on the slopes of a hill, the
          Savoy, operated by the Taj hotels, sprawls over six acres of
          landscaped gardens, offering colonial-style cottages built between
          1834 and 1865.


          The rooms have a colonial atmosphere with working fireplaces, wooden
          floors and brass fittings. Colorful flowerbeds merge to form a
          multi-coloured quilt around the cottages, adding to the old English
          Charm.

          The Savoy makes the best of its colonial heritage with very pukka
          British activities: high tea, croquet and letter-writing are on offer
          here, along with more modern pursuits like tea mixology. There’s
          plenty for kids to do, from pony rides to feeding animals. The more
          active might like to visit nearby tribal villages, do a spot of
          birding, or hike to Lamb’s Rock or the vantage point of Doddabetta.
          Wellness is also taken care of, with yoga and a luxurious spa on the
          premises.

          The focal point of the city is the 19th-century Maharaja’s Palace.
          Part of it is still used by the royal family on festive occasions; the
          other part is a museum. The collection, which includes a golden howdah
          (elephant saddle) that kings used during processions, gives a taste of
          the splendid lifestyle of the Wodeyar rulers of Mysore.


          The Wodeyars were devoted to the goddess Chamundesvari, enshrined on
          Chamundi Hill (13km away). Half way up the hill is a gigantic
          monolithic Nandi Bull, about 5m high. There is also a 12th-century
          temple dedicated to the goddess.


          The afternoon is at leisure.

          boat tours are available, and are a good way to see the park.

          city has beautiful parks, avenues and impressive buildings. Parts of
