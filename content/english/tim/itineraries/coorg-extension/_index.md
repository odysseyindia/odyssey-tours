          Today, you drive up the Western Ghats to Madikeri, the capital of the
          Coorg region. The market town of Madikeri is best known for its
          temples and 19th-century fort, which houses a museum and a chapel. You
          drive a little outside town to your hotel, located in a coffee
          plantation.


          The rest of the day is free for you to explore the plantation at
          leisure, perhaps with a plantation tour, or a spot of birding.

Coorg is a cool, green, mountainous area, famed for picturesque countryside, where the roads are lined with hedgerows, flowering trees, spice plantations and coffee estates. It is a perfect area for walks, ranging from simple strolls through the coffee plantations to longer treks in the surrounding mountains. Hiking cross-country, or simply driving down the mountain roads, you encounter panoramic views of the morning mist rolling down thickly wooded hills, undulating paddy fields and neat rows of coffee bushes. This is also a great spot for birding, with plenty of species endemic to the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot.
