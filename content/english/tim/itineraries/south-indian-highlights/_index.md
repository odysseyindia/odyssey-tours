          Formerly known as Madras, this is the capital of the state of Tamil
          Nadu. Chennai boasts of one of the longest city beaches in the world,
          and Marina Beach provides a refreshing contrast to the busy city
          centre.


          The Fort St. George area contains many reminders from the time the
          British established the East India Trading Company in the 17th
          century, including the oldest surviving Anglican church in Asia, the
          St. Mary’s Church.

          After breakfast, drive along the pleasant East Coast Road to
          Mamallapuram, where the 7th-century complex of monolithic rock-cut
          shrines and the legendary Shore Temple are now a World Heritage Site.
          The stunning archaeological remains co-exist with a long white-sand
          beach, making Mamallapuram a favourite destination for travellers.


          After visiting Mamallapuram, you continue for two hours down the
          coastal road to the lovely old French colony of Pondicherry. One can
          experience the colonial charm of the town by walking through its old
          quarter, which houses a varied collection of buildings, churches,
          homes, markets and thoroughfares with French names. You can also visit
          nearby Auroville, an interesting experiment in alternative living,
          with a very informative Visitors' Centre, and nice cafes and shops.

          striking designer hotels. Constructed in the 18th century as the
          residence of the Mayor of Pondicherry, the building stands white and
          majestic, just a few blocks from the promenade and a leafy park.


          Le Dupleix is elegant and luxurious, with beautiful woodwork, a very
          inviting bar and a grand air.

        content: >-
          Pondicherry is a wonderful place to explore on your own. The French
          Colonial section, or White Town, is a delight on foot, with
          pastel-coloured buildings under beautiful trees, a breezy promenade to
          cool off in, and plenty of quirky shops and cafes to stop at. The
          grid-like layout makes White Town easy to explore, too.


          A short drive outside Pondicherry is the spiritual, alternate-living
          city of Auroville. A fascinating set-up, the city is divided into
          sectors for living, relaxation and types of work. It is explored
          easily on foot, on cycle or in an electric vehicle (available at the
          Visitor Centre). There are also pleasant shops and cafes and lovely
          tree-lined areas to sit in.


          Please note: if you wish to visit the golden dome, you have to visit
          Auroville, register, and return two days later.

        title: Tranquebar
        content: >-
          You continue southwards today, stopping at the temple town of
          Chidambaram. One of Tamil Nadu’s most important holy towns,
          Chidambaram was the capital of the Chola empire for 400 years. The
          great Nataraja temple, dedicated to the dancing Shiva, was built
          during this period, and is one of the finest examples of Dravidian
          architecture. This huge complex is still an active temple, with
          Brahmins at every shrine. A visit to the temple affords a fascinating
          glimpse into ancient Tamil religious practice.


          You end the day at the small seaside town of Tranquebar, or
          Tharangambadi. While Pondicherry has its French legacy, Tranquebar (or
          Tharangambadi) is distinguished by its Danish past. It was once a
          sea-facing fort established for exports of spices, silks and other
          textiles. Its remnants include a gateway sporting the Danish Royal
          Seal, a peach-coloured fort, a string of imposing colonial bungalows,
          and two early 18th-century churches, in a charming beach location.


          The rest of your day is at leisure to explore Tranquebar’s fortress
          and beach on your own.

          The 19th-century Collector’s Residence in picturesque Tranquebar has
          been transformed from a ruin into a heritage hotel by the Neemrana
          Group. As bungalows on the beach go, this is a pretty grand one. A
          stolid Danish fort looms on one side, on the other a medieval Pandya
          temple. There are plenty of pleasant sitouts, comfortable olde-worlde
          rooms and superb food, which make it a great place to relax and not do
          very much.

          After breakfast, you drive two hours to the temple town of Kumbakonam.
          Legend has it that the Hindu god Shiva broke a kumbh (water pot) here,
          after it was brought here by a great flood. As a result this busy
          market town has many large and colourful temples dedicated to Shiva,
          some with highly refined Chola stone carving.


          Nearby at Darasuram is a magnificent 12th-century Chola temple, which
          should not be missed. The village of Swamimalai, just a bike ride
          away, is the state’s principal centre for traditional bronze-casting.

        content: >-
          Indeco Swamimalai is less a hotel and more a cross between a cultural
          village and an eccentric, wonderful museum. The reception building is
          an old lighthouse, transferred stone by stone from Chennai, and now
          contains a museum of British-era artifacts, alongside many others
          around the property. The rooms are large and stuffed with curios, the
          vegetarian food is excellent, and there are plenty of activities
          available.


          There are innumerable statues and artifact collections here, as well
          as a deer enclosure, a space for ducks, a special outdoor dining table
          with piped ‘rain’ for the summers, a swimming pool made to resemble a
          temple tank, and even the vast blue gate of the old Madras Central
          Jail!

          After breakfast, drive an hour to Thanjavur. The chief attraction of
          Thanjavur (or Tanjore) is the extraordinary Brihadishwara Temple.
          Built in 1010 by the Chola dynasty, who ruled much of Southern India
          for over 400 years, the temple is now a World Heritage monument. The
          immense main temple is over 60m high, and is hewn from a single piece
          of granite estimated to weigh 80 tonnes. An astonishing sight, one of
          the highlights of a trip to South India, which you can explore on your
          own.


          You continue onwards to Chettinad (or Chettinadu), a region in the
          heart of Tamil Nadu dominated by the prosperous Chettiar community of
          businessmen and bankers. Around the 19th and early 20th century, the
          Chettiars traded in everything from salt to gems, with countries like
          Burma, Malaysia and Singapore. They built palatial residences with
          materials sourced from all over the world, many now converted into
          elegant hotels. Chettinad is also famous for its exciting cuisine.

          A lovely, low-slung Chettiar mansion restored by a pair of French
          architects, Saratha Vilas elegantly places traditional architecture
          alongside modern touches. The rooms are cosy and comfortable, there is
          a cooking class you can take part in, and the pool area is inviting -
          especially after a day of cycling round the villages of Chettinad.

          The Chettiar’s main intent was to make his house a statement of his
          social success and he put everything into it: look out for Spanish
          tiles, Italian marble floors, Venetian chandeliers, and carved
          friezes. Many mansions are open to the public for a small fee. These
          houses are spread across pleasant villages, separated by palm-lined
          roads and paddy fields, easy to explore on your own in a car, or even
          on foot or by bicycle.


          You can also visit the tile-makers in Athangudi, creators of
          beautiful, colourful tiles for a century.

          of colourful bazaars, street tailors, throngs of pilgrims and joyful
          religious processions, Madurai is a bustling city that attracts
          thousands of visitors each day.


          Madurai’s main attraction is the famous temple dedicated to the
          Goddess Meenakshi. Each evening, there is a closing ceremony,
          accompanied by chanting priests, drummers and torchbearers in which an
          image of Shiva is carried in procession to Parvati’s bedroom.

          The Meenakshi temple is one of the finest and largest examples of
          Dravidian architecture. Its musical pillars, each of which is carved
          out of a single block of granite, let out musical notes when tapped.
          There is also the hall of a Thousand Pillars, part of which has
          converted into a museum.


          The Thirumalai Nayak Palace is situated 1km from the temple. Built in
          1636 by the king Thirumalai Nayak, it has pillars in Italian style, a
          Mughal arch and Dravidian decoration. The Vandiyur Mariamman Tank is a
          huge temple tank with a mandapam in the centre. During the ‘Floating
          Festival’ , the temple deities are taken out in the tank on floats.

          artfully renovated; the result is a hotel with lots of charm, and huge
          rooms.


          The restaurant serves Indian and international cuisine and there is a
          magnificent swimming pool to enjoy. There is also a ‘heritage
          village’, where you can see a potter at work, have some tea, and take
          a cooking class.

          In the evening, you set out to explore a lesser-known aspect of this
          temple town. Madurai is a city of surprises, its food being one of the
          biggest. Stroll along the area around the Meenakshi temple, and learn
          about Madurai’s customs as you meet shopkeepers, wander through
          bazaars and nibble on snacks. Try a milky jigar-thanda (literally,
          “cools the heart”), and even a wonderful drink made from cotton seeds!
          Finish off with a meal at a ‘mess’, with meat and fish to belie Tamil
          Nadu’s vegetarian reputation.


          If you’re interested, you can also visit the Meenakshi temple for its
          charming night ceremony, on your own.

          Learn about the medicinal and culinary uses of these spices, and about
          the geographical and climatic peculiarities of Thekkady such as the
          cool climate and its elevation above sea level, which make it ideal

          After breakfast, drive to Kochi, a journey of just over an hour
          through coastal villages. Kochi (or Cochin) is set on a cluster of
          islands and narrow peninsulas and has one of the best natural harbours
          in the world. The famed ‘Malabar Spices’ were exported from this very
          port, bringing to Kochi visitors as varied as the Arabs, the Dutch,
          the Portuguese and, finally, the British. All of them have left their
          mark on the architecture, making Kochi one of the most unique and
          fascinating towns in India.

          This is one of the true gems of Fort Cochin. Located only a street

          The Old Harbour Hotel has characterful rooms, nooks and corridors
          dotted with antiques, and a beautiful poolside area in the shade of
          huge rain trees, perfect for relaxing with a beer.

          At the entrance of Kochi harbour, the Chinese fishing nets are
          fascinating. A short walk away is St Francis Church, built by the
          Portuguese in 1510. Vasco da Gama, who died in 1524, was buried here.


          Also in Fort Kochi is a 17th-century Jewish synagogue. Scrolls of the
          Old Testament and copper plates inscribed in Hebrew are preserved
          here. There is also the ‘Dutch’ Palace, built by the Portuguese for
          the Raja of Cochin in 1555.

          This evening, you get to catch an evening performance of kathakali and
          other dances from Kerala. In kathakali, the actors depict characters
          from the Puranas and the Mahabharata - superhuman beings, demons, and
          ordinary men and women.


          The dancers, all males, adorn themselves in huge skirts and headdress,
          wearing what must surely be the most intricate make-up of any dance
          style in the world.
