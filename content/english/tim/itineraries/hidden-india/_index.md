          Ahmedabad is the cultural capital of Gujarat and a major textile and
          crafts centre. The city is packed with diverse architectural styles,
          with over fifty mosques and tombs, as well as Hindu and Jain temples
          and grand, beautifully-carved step-wells. The old part of town is a
          maze of narrow winding alleys with carved wooden house-fronts and
          thriving bazaars.

          It has beautifully decorated rooms and a wonderful ambience.


          Located in the heart of the city, the House of MG is also home to the
          perennially popular Agashiye, a rooftop restaurant that serves
          delicious traditional Gujarati food.

          You join a morning guided group walk through the narrow atmospheric
          lanes of the historic Old City. This is a fascinating maze of crowded
          bazaars, exquisitely carved facades, temples, subterranean stepwells,
          and even a secret passageway.


          You first walk through a Hindu-dominated area, then a section
          dominated by Jains, then finally to the Muslim market area to end at
          the city’s largest mosque.

        content: >-
          Alongside the Sabarmati River, the Ashram was the home of Mahatma
          Gandhi from 1915 to 1930, and the seeds of India’s Independence
          campaign were sown here. His simple living quarters are maintained
          exactly as they were at that time. There is also a museum dedicated to
          his life.


          The nearby Law Garden Market operates from late afternoon and has
          stalls selling colourful local fabrics, as well as a “food street”
          with local fast food outlets - the kulfi falooda is highly recommended
          at the end of a hot day.

          charming Garden Palace, built in 1883 and now run as a heritage hotel
          by the present Nawab.


          Balasinor is just 25km away from the prehistoric site of Raiyoli,
          India’s Jurassic Park, where the fossilized bones and eggs of
          dinosaurs can be seen.


          A visit to the park and other activities like a light hike can be
          booked directly at the hotel.

          giving it a wonderfully period feel.


          The Nawabs of Balasinor were known for their hospitality, with
          kitchens famous for their distinctive Nawabi cuisine, and this is a
          great place to actually spend time with royalty in their own home.

          A two-hour drive takes you to another hidden treasure. In the lap of
          the Aravalli Hills in Gujarat lies the untouched town of Santrampur,
          which is riddled with ancient palaces and striking temple ruins.


          Santrampur comprises two townships, Sant and Rampur. While Rampur is
          the commercial town or the ‘city centre’, Sant was reserved for the
          palaces. Santrampur and its neighbouring areas are predominantly
          inhabited by tribals.


          Your afternoon is at leisure.

          built in 1926 in Art Deco style.


          Five contemporary rooms and suites occupy the ground floor of the
          building, surrounding a magnificent central courtyard. Inside the
          suites and out, a confluence of royal aesthetics adorns the walls, the
          bathrooms, the tables, the door knockers, and the furniture.

          with an opportunity to spot migratory birds. Take a walk in the
          neighbouring forest to explore the local flora and fauna, or visit
          tribal homes and farms to experience the local culture, and have a
          picnic in the countryside nearby.

          You drive for about five hours into Madhya Pradesh, ending the day at
          the town of Barnagar. Just outside Barnagar is ‘Amla Heritage
          Village’, a quaint place that seems to be stuck in a time warp. Life
          here carries on as it must have for centuries, with the odd exception
          of an electrical flour mill.


          Amla has been ruled for generations by the family of Raghavendra
          Singh, who operates the Fort Amla heritage hotel.

          back to the 8th century. This sprawling building of wide sweeping
          arches and open courtyards houses simple, cosy rooms.


          Your host is a great source of stories about this traditional village,
          where he is the unofficial banker, court of appeal and general go-to
          man for anything the villagers need, just as in medieval times
          (including childbirth advice!).

        content: >-
          Today, you have a five-hour drive ahead, broken at the holy city of
          Ujjain.


          Ujjain draws visitors mainly for its famous Hindu shrines and the
          ghats or stone steps that lead down to the Shipra River. Ujjain is one
          of the four sites to host the Kumbh Mela, the largest religious
          gathering in the world. Every 12 years, millions of Hindus come
          together to take a dip in the holy Shipra. However, Ujjain’s ghats are
          worth visiting even when the Kumbh Mela isn’t on, a mini Varanasi full
          of colour and history.


          You continue to Bhopal, the under-rated capital of Madhya Pradesh, a
          surprising mix of medieval Hindu and Islamic architecture, and modern
          town-planning. It is a fast-growing city situated on gently-rolling
          hills and around two man-made lakes. Bhopal is perfect for visiting
          the stupas and abandoned monasteries of Sanchi, one of the most
          important Buddhist sites, and the cave shrines of Udaigiri and
          prehistoric cave paintings of Bhimbetka.

          the beautifully-preserved erstwhile home of the rulers of Bhopal. The
          abundance of space has also allowed for airy rooms with large beds and
          stylish colonial furniture in dark wood.


          Unlike most city hotels, Jehan Numa Palace boasts of wide balconies,
          open lawns, fountains and many inviting spots to relax and unwind
          after a day of sightseeing.

          Amongst the boulder-strewn landscape of the Vindhya mountains is a

          Visitors are allowed to venture into 15 of these rock shelters to see
          cave paintings in bold red, white and yellow depicting animals, hunts
          and the daily scenes in the lives of people during the Stone Age.
          UNESCO has acknowledged this treasure by giving World Cultural
          Heritage status.

          The Taj-ul-Masjid is one of India’s largest mosques, a huge pink

          architecturally akin to Delhi’s Jama Masjid. Bharat Bhawan houses an
          impressive collection of rural and tribal arts, a modern art and
          crafts gallery, and more.


          The Museum of Man is an open-air museum of tribal life, with replicas
          of adivasi (aboriginal) houses, compounds and shrines spread over an
          entire hillock.

          stupa is encircled by a railing cut by four exquisitely-carved
          gateways facing the four directions of the compass. The carvings show
          a world of people and animals living together in happiness and plenty.


          The Udaigiri Caves are famous for rock-cut Buddhist sanctuaries,
          carved into a sandstone hill.

          An afternoon train takes you to small but extremely interesting
          Gwalior, under the looming 1,000-year-old fortress. The mighty Scindia
          family once ruled the state of Gwalior, one of the most highly
          regarded princely states of India, and the old town has their slightly
          over-the-top 19th-century Jai Vilas Palace. Part of the palace is the
          present Maharaja’s residence; the other is now a museum.

          The Jai Vilas Palace is home to the Scindia family, done in Italian,
          Tuscan and Corinthian styles. One part is now a museum, with an

          A unique feature of Dholpur is its closeness to the Chambal ravines of
          Madhya Pradesh, once famous for their bandits - and now for great
          birding and crocodile-spotting. You can explore the area by boat and

A trip through one of the most fascinating, yet most easily overlooked belts of India. Starting in the culturally rich city of Ahmedabad, visiting Mahatma Gandhi’s Sabarmati Ashram, you go on to two royal stays, one a charming garden palace by a park containing amazing dinosaur fossils, and the other a completely hidden and beautifully decorated palace by the lake in Santrampur. You carry on to tiny Barnagar, to a castle that feels like it dropped out of history, and then to the utterly surprising Bhopal, a city of great culture, to stay in a lovely palace and explore prehistoric caves and soothing Buddhist sites. You then travel along the river Chambal to Gwalior’s huge fort and end at serene Dholpur’s castle, a great base to look for birds and endangered crocodiles on the water. A stirring, offbeat trip.
