          Delhi is practically two cities: New Delhi, the capital of India, and
          medieval Old Delhi. The old city centres around the Red Fort, which
          contains opulent palaces and impressive public buildings. Nearby is
          the magnificent Jama Masjid, India’s largest mosque. In New Delhi you
          can find India Gate - a war memorial arch, the impressive Parliament
          Building and Rashtrapati Bhawan, the residence of the President.
          Towards the South are Qutab Minar and Humayun’s Tomb, both World
          Heritage Sites.

        title: Morning guided tour of New Delhi
        content: >-
          New Delhi has a number of attractions, like Humayun’s Tomb, a
          sandstone mausoleum in the authentic Mughal style - the Taj Mahal,
          built much later, follows a similar style of architecture. Nearby you
          can see India Gate, the Parliament Buildings, the Lodhi Gardens, the
          Lotus Temple, the President’s House, and the Sikh temple, Gurudwara
          Bangla Sahib. However, Delhi is huge and traffic is usually heavy, and
          half a day is not enough to see all of the attractions, so it is best
          to discuss with your guide which sights you might wish to visit.


          The afternoon is free for you to relax or explore further on your own.

          After breakfast, a five-hour drive takes you to the fairytale palace
          of Samode, nestled among rugged hills, and the narrow cobbled streets
          of the village it overlooks. This superbly restored 18th-century
          palace was put on the map by its starring role in the 1984 mini-series
          ‘The Far Pavilions’. Coming from Jaipur, Samode is the gateway to the
          famous Shekhawati region. The palace itself has several frescoes -
          original and also restored, in many of its public areas.


          The day is free for you to enjoy the palace.

          the finest of Shekhavati-style frescoes. The rooms have old-world
          charm replete with antique furniture, and fabulous modern bathrooms.
          There are two delightful swimming pools, and several atmospheric
          dining areas.

          Today, you have the terrible burden of exploring and enjoying the
          palace, trying to decide which swimming pool to laze by, which
          restaurant to eat in, and what spa treatment to endure. We hope it
          isn’t too strenuous to bear!


          Alternatively, you can also explore the quaint village on foot or
          camel back or enjoy a picnic lunch in the mango orchard of nearby
          Samode Bagh, the old royal hunting lodge, which has beautiful gardens.
          For those with energy to burn, you can climb the 376 steps beside the
          Palace to the Samode Fort that once protected the kingdom. The climb
          is steep but the views across the valley make it worth the effort.

          Just an hour away is Jaipur, one of the most interesting cities in
          India, with exuberant 18th- and 19th-century palaces and exotic street
          life. Just outside town is the impressive Amber Fort. It is worthwhile
          spending time wandering through the bazaars. Jaipur is well known for
          its beautiful carpets, enameled ornaments, precious and semi-precious
          stones, brass ornaments and many other arts and crafts.


          The rest of the day is at leisure to enjoy the hotel, or to explore
          Jaipur on your own.

          The rooms in the rambling building are well furnished with local
          hand-block printed fabrics and period furniture. The restaurant is
          decorated with exquisite frescoes. The pool area, with a bar and spa,
          is a very welcome area for relaxation. A genteel, luxurious option in
          Jaipur.

          To experience the life of the Pink City beyond the monuments, it is
          best to join a guided morning walk. Starting in the heart of the Old
          City, you will walk along the busy main streets, lined with parades of
          traditional shops, and explore smaller side streets, each devoted to
          different crafts.


          You will see various tradesmen, such as marble-sculptors and
          bangle-makers at work, visit local temples, see the colourful
          vegetable and flower markets, and sample delicious street foods, such
          as jalebis, rabri, kachoris, and lassi.

          courtyard, which leads to a magnificent complex of palaces, halls,
          pavilions, gardens and temples built over 125 years. There are
          excellent views down over the old town of Amer, and up to the Jaigarh
          and Nahargarh Forts higher in the hills.

        content: >-
          Perched on a hilltop dominating the city, Meherangarh Fort is the most
          visually spectacular in Rajasthan. It is approached by a series of
          seven gateways set at an angle to hinder invading armies. Past the
          gates, the fort-palace has huge courtyards surrounded by wings of
          palatial buildings, part of which is now turned into a fabulous
          museum. An excellent audio tour is included in the entrance fee, and
          this leads you through the museum within the Fort.


          Afterwards, it is well worth exploring the ramparts of the fort, with
          their superb views. The Jaswant Thada memorial lies on the approach to
          the Fort, and the large white marble structure is surrounded by the
          cremation grounds of former rulers.


          The afternoon is at leisure to further explore Jodhpur on your own.

          This off-the-beaten-track village houses a 300-year-old fort, now
          converted into a small luxury heritage hotel. The 13th-generation

          picturesque city. High whitewashed houses and narrow, winding alleys

          residence of the Maharana, is carved out of yellow sandstone and

          views over the lake and the famous Lake Palace Hotel.

Nowhere in India is the romance of the Maharajahs as strong as in Rajasthan, the land of kings. Impressive forts and castles, opulent palaces, and havelis built around courtyards dot this desert state. In this very special tour, we take you to some stunning examples of India’s royal past. Most of the overnight halts on this tour are in castles and princely homes, which are still the residence of the erstwhile royal families.
