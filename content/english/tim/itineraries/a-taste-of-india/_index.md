          Delhi is practically two cities: New Delhi, the capital of India, and
          medieval Old Delhi. The old city centres around the Red Fort, which
          contains opulent palaces and impressive public buildings. Nearby is
          the magnificent Jama Masjid, India’s largest mosque. In New Delhi you
          can find India Gate - a war memorial arch, the impressive Parliament
          Building and Rashtrapati Bhawan, the residence of the President.
          Towards the South are Qutab Minar and Humayun’s Tomb, both World
          Heritage Sites.

        title: Morning tour of Old Delhi by Metro & rickshaw
        content: >-
          A half-day tour to Old Delhi using the modern Metro and the
          traditional cycle rickshaw. The Metro brings you to the heart of Old
          Delhi in just a few minutes, to visit the magnificent Jama Masjid
          mosque, India’s largest. You then use walk and ride cycle rickshaws
          through the fascinating maze of narrow streets around the main street
          of Old Delhi, Chandni Chowk, a bustling jumble of craft shops,
          traders, mosques and temples.


          At one end of this street is the huge Red Fort, the symbol of Delhi,
          which contains within it palaces and impressive public buildings.
          (Please note, though, that we will not go inside the Red Fort, because
          on this tour we concentrate on the narrow alleys and atmosphere of Old
          Delhi. However, you could arrange with your local guide to see the Red
          Fort at the end of your half-day tour). At the other end of Chandni
          Chowk is the colourful and aromatic Spice Market, the roof of which
          offers great views over Old Delhi. You can also visit the bustling and
          colourful Sikh Gurdwara.


          Afterwards, we recommend that you go to Karim’s for lunch. Established
          in 1913, the restaurant has been described as synonymous with Old
          Delhi, and arguably the city’s most famous culinary destination.

          An early start takes you by train to one of India’s best food
          destinations, just in time for lunch! Lucknow, the capital of Uttar
          Pradesh, extends along the banks of the River Gomti, and is known for
          its elaborate cuisine and its ‘tehzeeb’ or graciousness.


          The city, known earlier as Awadh, rapidly developed under the Mughal
          Emperor Akbar’s patronage in the 16th century. Today, the city is
          dotted with remnants of its historic past. Lucknow is also known for
          its traditional perfume and exquisite shadow-work embroidery on fine
          muslin cloth.

          The Bara Imambara is a magnificent monument that recalls the glorious
          past of the nawabs. A remarkable feature is the absence of pillars
          supporting the vaulted main hall.


          The Chota Imambara is another fine monument from the time of the
          Nawabs. Nearby is Hussainabad Picture Gallery, with life-size
          portraits of the Nawabs of Avadh.


          The Residency was the scene of dramatic events during the mutiny of
          1857, also called the First Indian War of Independence. The scarred
          ruins tell the story of the British community besieged by the rebels.

          Our culinary guide and driver will pick you up from your hotel to take
          you to a part of Lucknow which has a famous colony of chefs, called
          ‘Bawarchi Tola’. In this colony one may still find chefs whose
          forefathers used to cook a special kind of dish for the royals of
          Avadh. There is a street full of eateries where one can find the best
          from Lucknow’s very own traditional kitchens.


          You can hop in and out of these traditional roadside eateries to try a
          variety of different kinds of delicious local foods. This tour is
          essentially for meat lovers; a perfect opportunity to get a taste of
          the famous Awadhi cuisine!

          You’ll probably need a relaxed morning after the previous day’s feast,
          so you only need to leave in the afternoon by train to Agra, getting
          there by evening.


          Agra is home to possibly the most famous and beautiful building in the
          world: the Taj Mahal, built in the 17th century by the Mughal emperor
          Shah Jahan as a tomb and memorial for his wife Mumtaz Mahal. Along the
          river Yamuna is the impressive Red Fort, the capital of the Mughal
          Empire during the 16th and 17th centuries.

          The best time of day to appreciate this stunning monument is as soon
          as the Taj Mahal opens, when it is at its quietest and most serene.
          You can enjoy the gardens, the mausoleum and the mosque, without
          needing a professional guide. Don’t miss the marble inlay work and the
          various vantage points offered throughout the peaceful gardens.


          Once you have taken it all in, you can return to your hotel for a late
          breakfast.

          Agra has much to offer besides the Taj Mahal, such as Agra Fort, a
          masterpiece of design and construction. You then visit
          Itimad-ud-Daulah’s tomb - better known as the Baby Taj, which also
          features the same marble inlay work as the Taj Mahal. Finally you will
          visit Mehtab Bagh, a formally laid-out Mughal garden that offers
          stupendous views of the Taj Mahal, especially in the late afternoon.

          Today, you have a long drive to Jaipur, but with some very interesting
          optional stops along the way, at the grand folly of Fatehpur Sikri,
          Bharatpur bird sanctuary, and the huge Abhaneri step-well. Depending
          on the stops you make, the drive takes from five hours to most of the
          day.


          Jaipur is one of the most interesting cities in India, with exuberant
          18th- and 19th-century palaces and exotic street life. Just outside
          town is the impressive Amber Fort. It is worthwhile spending time
          wandering through the bazaars. Jaipur is well known for its beautiful
          carpets, enameled ornaments, precious and semi-precious stones, brass
          ornaments and many other arts and crafts.

          different crafts.

          vegetable and flower markets, and sample delicious street foods, such

          Driving south from Udaipur for about three hours gets you to a hidden
          gem. Dungarpur has one of the finest palaces in Rajasthan, the
          19th-century Udai Bilas Palace, now a heritage hotel. The palace is
          located on the shore of a peaceful lake, which attracts a large number
          of aquatic birds like pelicans and spoonbills. The lake contains a
          small island, which houses the family temple of the owners of the
          palace.

          There is a lot to do in and around the palace at Dungarpur, from
          taking a dip in the beautiful lakeside swimming pool (a great spot for
          bird-watching as well), to exploring the amazing inner courtyard with
          its intricately carved miniature tower. There is also a private
          museum, with a whimsical collection of artifacts, paintings, garments
          and arms. You can also visit the 13th-century Juna Mahal (Old Palace),
          which has exquisite frescoes, miniatures, glass and mirror inlay work.


          Another attraction is the Dungarpur Mews, a 100-year-old stable, first
          converted into a garage and then into a lovely, fun bar-cum-vintage
          car museum, which features classic cars, motorcycles, carriages, and
          even two aircraft!

          Today, you enter a new state, reaching Ahmedabad after a three-hour
          drive. Ahmedabad is the cultural capital of Gujarat and a major
          textile and crafts centre.


          The city is packed with diverse architectural styles, with over fifty
          mosques and tombs, as well as Hindu and Jain temples and grand,
          beautifully-carved step-wells. The old part of town is a maze of
          narrow winding alleys with carved wooden house-fronts and thriving
          bazaars.


          The afternoon is free for you to explore on your own, and there’s
          plenty of street food to try around here. We recommend that you have
          dinner at Agashiye, an iconic traditional Gujarati thali restaurant
          located at the roof top of The House of MG.

          It has beautifully decorated rooms and a wonderful ambience. Located
          in the heart of the city, the House of MG is also the home to the
          perennially popular Agashiye, a rooftop restaurant that serves
          delicious traditional Gujarati food.

          You board an afternoon train to Mumbai, the financial, commercial and
          industrial capital of India, getting there at night. The city is also
          the centre of fashion and film-making.


          The city hums with activity and its 15 million residents seem to be
          constantly on the move. Mumbai used to be just a collection of fishing
          villages, and first grew only during British colonial rule, so most of
          the historical monuments are relics from the Raj.

          ground-floor restaurant, and a lovely Cuba-themed cafe-bar.

          Starting with the iconic Gateway of India, we explore the Colaba and
          Fort areas of Mumbai on foot. Mumbai’s most distinctive colonial-era
          architecture is found here, in buildings such as the Prince of Wales
          Museum, the High Court, and the University. The street life is also
          fascinating.


          On weekdays the walk ends at Churchgate railway station, where the
          famous ‘dabba-wallas’ arrange the distribution of thousands of ‘tiffin
          boxes’ - packed lunches for office workers which they transport from
          suburban residences to offices throughout South Mumbai.

          Food speaks volumes about the world’s cultures, and nowhere more so
          than Mumbai - a city best experienced through its diverse and
          delicious street food in this small group excursion.


          We first visit Chowpatty Beach, the best place to taste Mumbai’s
          vegetarian favourites such as pav bhaji and pani puri. You also get to
          try sweets, such as hand-churned ice cream in unfamiliar flavours at a
          120-year-old shop, and a super-sugary, bright orange jalebi.


          We then visit the bazaars of Muslim-dominated Mohammed Ali Road, known
          for its khau gallis (eating lanes), where you get to try Mumbai
          classics such as bhel puri and kebabs, as well as some lesser-known
          foods unique to this area, such as offal. While some of the items here
          are non-vegetarian, there are also plenty of options for vegetarians.
