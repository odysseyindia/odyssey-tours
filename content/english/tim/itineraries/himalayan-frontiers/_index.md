          Your tour starts when you arrive at Badgogra airport, where you are
          met by our representative. You will be then take the three-hour drive
          to scenic Darjeeling. You go to Darjeeling to enjoy the atmosphere of
          the British Raj, the lush green tea plantations, the magnificent views
          of the Kanchenjunga and the colourful hill people of the Northeastern
          Himalayas.


          During the British Raj in India, Darjeeling's temperate climate led to
          its development as a hill station (hill town) for British residents to
          escape the heat of the plains during the summers, becoming known as
          the Summer Capital.

          You start before dawn for an early morning drive through Ghoom and the
          woodlands to watch the sunrise from Tiger Hill. This incredible
          viewpoint, at an altitude of 2585 metres, provides an unparalleled
          Himalayan panorama, including Everest and Kanchenjunga in clear
          weather. On the way back to Darjeeling, you stop to visit the old
          monastery of Ghoom. This is probably the most famous monastery in
          Darjeeling.

          Today, you get to stay at a living, working farm! You cross into the
          beautiful state of Sikkim, a tiny but beautiful state, sandwiched
          between Tibet, Nepal and Bhutan. This three-hour drive takes you to
          Rinchenpong, a small village at an altitude of nearly 6,000ft. The
          name means "Assembly Place" in the local Lepcha dialect. It is a place
          for the people who love tranquility and traditional lifestyles, far
          from the madding crowd. The distant views of the Himalayas, abundant
          fresh air, lush green forest, and surrounding farmland create a
          pleasant and peaceful atmosphere.

          THere's always something to do at a farm: you can help with the daily
          activities, feeding the animals and more, and learn how to make
          farm-to-table Sikkimese food. There are also a number of walking
          trails around Yangsum Farm and Rinchenpong, where hikers get to
          experience the rich and diverse vegetation of Sikkim. The walks are
          through villages and forest, and you'll get to see the culture and the
          unique cultivation methods used here. You can also go on birding
          walks, along with a member of the family, who are keen birders. All
          these activities can be booked directly at the farm.

          After breakfast, drive about two hours to the mountain town of
          Pelling, perched on a ridge, where a number of hotels compete to offer
          the best views of the Kanchenjunga range of the Himalayas. The view is
          usually clearest in the early mornings, and is best seen from the
          nearby hilltop Sanga Choeling Monastery. Pelling is also near the
          famous monastery of Pemayangtse, where you can see an exceptional
          collection of religious artworks, and the ruins of Rabdentse, Sikkim's
          second capital.

          The awe-inspiring ancient monastery of Pemayangtse, literally ‘perfect
          sublime lotus’, is the second-oldest in Sikkim. Traditional frescoes
          depicting tantrik Buddhist themes adorn the walls, and the highlight
          is the intricate seven-storey representation of a “Heavenly Palace.”
          Nearby are the ruins of Rabdentse, the second capital of Sikkim,
          reached by a short path through the surrounding forests.

          Early in the morning, your guide will lead you on the 3km hike to
          Sanga Choling Monastery, perched on top of a hill. It will take you no
          more than an hour to hike up to the monastery along a narrow path, and
          it’s definitely worth the effort. This is the oldest monastery in
          Sikkim, giving you magnificent views of the verdant foothills and the
          imposing mountains behind them.

          After your hike and breakfast, you can rest on the five-hour drive to
          Gangtok, the capital of Sikkim. The mountainsides here are covered
          with orchids and vast forests of rhododendrons. Apart from the
          mountain scenery, the main attraction of Sikkim is its Buddhist
          monasteries. Sikkim is home to over 250 of these, and while some are
          deserted, most others like Rumtek are thriving centres of Buddhism.
          The evening is at leisure if you'd like to explore the pleasant
          pedestrianised centre of town.

          It is a winding and bumpy drive to Phodang monastery, a small
          monastery 40km north of Gangtok, with a serene, timeless atmosphere.
          Lying on a spur of the hill, it has views of the valley below. Labrang
          Monastery is 2km uphill from Phodang, and is a small, unusual
          octagonal structure. You can enjoy the spectacular scenery and views
          of the Kanchenjunga.

          Today, you drive out of Gangtok to the monastery at Rumtek, 24km away.
          Rumtek was built in 1740 but had to be rebuilt during the 1960s after
          an earthquake. Brightly-painted wooden latticework decorates the
          facade. Inside are beautiful murals and thangka paintings. You are
          welcome to sit in on the prayer and chanting sessions. They'll even
          bring you a cup of salted butter tea when it's served to the monks.


          After this, you drive to the hillside town of Kalimpong. Before the
          Chinese takeover of Tibet, Kalimpong was the centre of India's wool
          trade with that country, with Tibetan caravans winding their way down
          from the Tibetan plateau to trade wool for manufactured goods. Even
          today, Kalimpong is home to diverse communities, and a short walk
          reveals temples, monasteries, churches and mosques. Kalimpong is also
          a centre for bird watching, hikes, and world-famous flower nurseries.


          The rest of the day is free for you to relax in the pleasant grounds
          of your hotel.
