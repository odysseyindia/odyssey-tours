          Corbett National Park was India’s first national park, and remains one
          of its finest. It is named after the legendary hunter Jim Corbett, who
          lived in this area for many years and wrote ‘The Man Eaters of
          Kumaon’. Extending over 520 sq. km., the sanctuary is endowed with
          breathtaking natural beauty and an abundance of wildlife including
          tigers and elephants. The birdlife is especially impressive, with over
          500 species.
