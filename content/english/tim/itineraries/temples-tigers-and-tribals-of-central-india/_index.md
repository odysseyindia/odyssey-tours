          Delhi is practically two cities: New Delhi, the capital of India, and
          medieval Old Delhi. The old city centres around the Red Fort, which
          contains opulent palaces and impressive public buildings. Nearby is
          the magnificent Jama Masjid, Indiaâ€™s largest mosque.


          In New Delhi you can find India Gate - a war memorial arch, the
          impressive Parliament Building and Rashtrapati Bhawan, the residence
          of the President. Towards the South are Qutab Minar and Humayun's
          Tomb, both World Heritage Sites.

        title: Morning guided tour of Old Delhi by Metro & rickshaw
        content: >-
          A half-day tour to Old Delhi using the modern Metro and the
          traditional cycle rickshaw. The Metro brings you to the heart of Old
          Delhi in just a few minutes, to visit the magnificent Jama Masjid
          mosque, India's largest. You then use walk and ride cycle rickshaws
          through the fascinating maze of narrow streets around the main street
          of Old Delhi, Chandni Chowk, a bustling jumble of craft shops,
          traders, mosques and temples.


          At one end of this street is the huge Red Fort, the symbol of Delhi,
          which contains within it palaces and impressive public buildings.
          (Please note, though, that we will not go inside the Red Fort, because
          on this tour we concentrate on the narrow alleys and atmosphere of Old
          Delhi. However, you could arrange with your local guide to see the Red
          Fort at the end of your half-day tour). At the other end of Chandni
          Chowk is the colourful and aromatic Spice Market, the roof of which
          offers great views over Old Delhi. You can also visit the bustling and
          colourful Sikh Gurdwara.


          The rest of your day is at leisure. If you'd like to go shopping or
          explore a bit more after the tour, you can take the Metro to vibrant
          Connaught Place to enjoy the many restaurants and more modern shops.

          An early-morning train and a short drive take you to tiny Orchha, in
          northern Madhya Pradesh. This medieval town is an architectural gem:
          during the 16th and 17th centuries, this was the capital of the
          Bundela dynasty, who built a palace on a small river island, followed
          by other magnificent palaces and temples. It is now a peaceful and
          easygoing place - perfect for relaxation and exploration of the ruins.


          The afternoon is free for you to explore this little town on your own.

          Mahal and Jehangir Mahal boast a unique combination of Hindu & Muslim
          architecture, with painted decorations and tile-work.


          The Laxmi Temple has more modern artwork and beautiful murals. The
          vast, cathedral-like Chaturbhuj temple and the active Ram Raja Temple
          in the colourful market area are popular with local worshippers, and
          the grand cenotaphs overlook the Betwa River, which is used by the
          locals for bathing.

          Today, you drive through the central Indian countryside for about four
          hours to Khajuraho, world-renowned for its intricately-carved temples.


          The temples are best known for their erotic sculptures, running
          through a whole Kamasutra of positions and possibilities that leave
          little to the imagination, but in fact, most of the carvings are of
          celestial figures, delicate and graceful, and well worth the visit.

        content: >-
          Of the original eighty five temples, twenty five remain today, with
          the largest and best preserved, the main Western Group of Temples, in
          a well-tended garden. The sculptures are sublime and sensuous at the
          same time. They adorn the temple walls, depicting themes of celestial
          nymphs, ascetics in penance, hunting and war scenes, group dances and
          royal processions.


          It is also worth visiting the smaller Eastern Group of Temples, also
          known as the Jain Temples, which, whilst much smaller, boast some of
          the most refined stone carving.

          You have to wake up before dawn today, but the reward is a jeep safari
          in nearby Panna National Park.


          Situated in the Vindhya Hills along the Ken River, Panna hosts lush
          teak forest and waterfalls, and shelters one of India's most renowned
          tiger reserves, along with more than 200 other animal and bird
          species. You explore the wilderness of the park by jeep with your
          guide, and look for the elusive tigers and other animals in the
          jungle.


          You return to your hotel by late morning, and the rest of the day is

          national park, to Bhoramdeo, a small village in the largely tribal
          state of Chhattisgarh.


          The Maikal Hills that surround Bhoramdeo are home to many species of
          central India's spectacular wildlife as well as to the indigenous
          Baiga and Gond tribes, whose tolas (villages) dot the countryside.
          Bhoramdeo is also known for its 11th-century temple complex, a
          miniature local Khajuraho of similar antiquity but rather more
          exclusive.


          You arrive in time for a home-grown lunch, and you can either just
          relax or saunter outside to visit the temples, a minute's walk from
          the farm-stay. There's usually some excursion every day as well,
          either to a tribal market or village, or a nature walk, so please
          check with your host.
