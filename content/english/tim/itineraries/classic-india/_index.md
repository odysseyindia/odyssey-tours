          Delhi is practically two cities: New Delhi, the capital of India, and
          medieval Old Delhi. The old city centres around the Red Fort, which
          contains opulent palaces and impressive public buildings. Nearby is
          the magnificent Jama Masjid, India’s largest mosque. In New Delhi you
          can find India Gate - a war memorial arch, the impressive Parliament
          Building and Rashtrapati Bhawan, the residence of the President.
          Towards the South are Qutab Minar and Humayun’s Tomb, both World
          Heritage Sites.

        title: Morning guided tour of Old Delhi by Metro & rickshaw
        content: >-
          A half-day tour to Old Delhi using the modern Metro and the
          traditional cycle rickshaw. The Metro brings you to the heart of Old
          Delhi in just a few minutes, to visit the magnificent Jama Masjid
          mosque, India’s largest. You then use walk and ride cycle rickshaws
          through the fascinating maze of narrow streets around the main street
          of Old Delhi, Chandni Chowk, a bustling jumble of craft shops,
          traders, mosques and temples.


          At one end of this street is the huge Red Fort, the symbol of Delhi,
          which contains within it palaces and impressive public buildings.
          (Please note, though, that we will not go inside the Red Fort, because
          on this tour we concentrate on the narrow alleys and atmosphere of Old
          Delhi. However, you could arrange with your local guide to see the Red
          Fort at the end of your half-day tour). At the other end of Chandni
          Chowk is the colourful and aromatic Spice Market, the roof of which
          offers great views over Old Delhi. You can also visit the bustling and
          colourful Sikh Gurdwara.


          The rest of your day is at leisure. If you’d like to go shopping or
          explore a bit more after the tour, you can take the Metro to vibrant
          Connaught Place to enjoy the many restaurants and more modern shops.

          Today, you drive to Jaipur, which takes about five hours along a good,
          if busy, highway, with time to just relax afterwards.


          The capital of the state of Rajasthan is one of the most interesting
          cities in India, with exuberant 18th- and 19th-century palaces and
          exotic street life. Just outside town is the impressive Amber Fort. It
          is worthwhile spending time wandering through the bazaars. Jaipur is
          well known for its beautiful carpets, enameled ornaments, precious and
          semi-precious stones, brass ornaments and many other arts and crafts.

          Jaipur as you cycle through the narrow alleys to get a peek into
          homes, kitchens and workshops. You learn about the lives of the locals
          and the history of the city, and visit the colourful and bustling
          vegetable and flower markets. You will also enjoy a traditional
          Rajasthani breakfast in a local house.

          You will meet your guide directly after the cycling tour, who will
          accompany you to Amber Fort, just to the north of Jaipur. There is a
          short, steep walk up to the entrance courtyard, which leads to a
          magnificent complex of palaces, halls, pavilions, gardens and temples
          built over 125 years. There are excellent views down over the old town
          of Amer, and up to the Jaigarh and Nahargarh Forts higher in the
          hills.


          The rest of your day is at leisure to explore Jaipur’s lovely markets
          on your own.

        content: >-
          Today, you have a long drive to Agra, but with some very interesting
          optional stops along the way, at the huge Abhaneri step-well,
          Bharatpur bird sanctuary and the grand folly of Fatehpur Sikri.
          Depending on the stops you make, the drive takes from five hours to
          most of the day.


          Agra is home to possibly the most famous and beautiful building in the
          world: the Taj Mahal, built in the 17th century by the Mughal emperor
          Shah Jahan as a tomb and memorial for his wife Mumtaz Mahal. Along the
          river Yamuna is the impressive Red Fort, the capital of the Mughal
          Empire during the 16th and 17th centuries.

        title: Early morning visit on your own to the Taj Mahal
        content: >-
          The best time of day to appreciate this stunning monument is as soon
          as the Taj Mahal opens, when it is at its quietest and most serene.
          You can enjoy the gardens, the mausoleum and the mosque, without
          needing a professional guide. Don’t miss the marble inlay work and the
          various vantage points offered throughout the peaceful gardens.


          Once you have taken it all in, you can return to your hotel for a late
          breakfast.

          Agra has much to offer besides the Taj Mahal, such as Agra Fort, a
          masterpiece of design and construction. You then visit
          Itimad-ud-Daulah’s tomb - better known as the Baby Taj, which also
          features the same marble inlay work as the Taj Mahal. Finally you will
          visit Mehtab Bagh, a formally laid-out Mughal garden that offers
          stupendous views of the Taj Mahal, especially in the late afternoon.

        content: >-
          An early-morning train and a short drive take you to tiny Orchha, in
          northern Madhya Pradesh. This medieval town is an architectural gem:
          during the 16th and 17th centuries, this was the capital of the
          Bundela dynasty, who built a palace on a small river island, followed
          by other magnificent palaces and temples. It is now a peaceful and
          easygoing place - perfect for relaxation and exploration of the ruins.

          The huge monuments of the Bundela kings surround and dwarf the small
          village of Orchha. The largest is the palace complex, where the Raj
          Mahal and Jehangir Mahal boast a unique combination of Hindu & Muslim
          architecture, with painted decorations and tile-work.


          The Laxmi Temple has more modern artwork and beautiful murals. The
          vast, cathedral-like Chaturbhuj temple and the active Ram Raja Temple
          in the colourful market area are popular with local worshippers, and
          the grand cenotaphs overlook the Betwa River, which is used by the
          locals for bathing.

          rooms surrounding a large swimming pool. Its gardens have an
          unrestricted view of the famous royal cenotaphs and there are plenty
          of comfortable outdoor spots in which to relax in and enjoy the sense
          of space and peace.

          Today, you drive through the central Indian countryside for about four
          hours to Khajuraho, world-renowned for its intricately-carved temples.
          The temples are best known for their erotic sculptures, running
          through a whole Kamasutra of positions and possibilities that leave
          little to the imagination, but in fact, most of the carvings are of
          celestial figures, delicate and graceful, and well worth the visit.

          cream shades and rich fabrics, and have large bay windows, with views
          of either the central swimming pool, or the garden that surrounds the
          property, making this a peaceful place to relax.

          Of the original eighty five temples, twenty five remain today, with
          the largest and best preserved, the main Western Group of Temples, in
          a well-tended garden. The sculptures are sublime and sensuous at the
          same time. They adorn the temple walls, depicting themes of celestial
          nymphs, ascetics in penance, hunting and war scenes, group dances and
          royal processions. It is also worth visiting the smaller Eastern Group
          of Temples, also known as the Jain Temples, which, whilst much
          smaller, boast some of the most refined stone carving.


          The afternoon is at leisure to explore this quiet town on your own.

          A short flight takes you to Varanasi, one of the most important places
          for Hindus: it’s believed that anyone who dies here will be liberated
          from the cycle of reincarnation, and bathing in the Ganges River is
          said to cleanse away all sins. The fascinating thing is that the
          rituals are conducted openly along the many riverside ghats, which are
          used for everything from bathing to burning the bodies of the dead. It
          is not the easiest city to appreciate as it is noisy and crowded, but
          it is certainly one of the most memorable places you will ever visit.


          Varanasi’s riverside ghats are fabulous for exploring on your own -
          the rest of the day is free for you to walk around and absorb the
          unique atmosphere.

          Your guide meets you at the hotel before sunrise, so you can watch the
          amazing Subah-e-Benares spectacle, which takes place on Varanasi’s
          waterfront every morning. The principal attraction of Varanasi is the
          long string of bathing ghats by the river, where pilgrims make their
          sin-cleansing dip in the holy river and on which bodies are cremated.
          A boat ride on the Ganges at dawn, when it is full of pilgrims, is an
          amazing experience, and your guide can explain the various rituals
          taking place.


          Leaving the boat after passing the most important ghats, you then
          continue on foot for a fascinating exploration of the narrow lanes of
          the Bengali Tola area, one of the oldest continuously-inhabited places
          on earth, passing countless small temples, shrines, and traditional
          shops. Your guide will provide a unique insight into this most
          fascinating of cities. At the end of the walk, you return to the hotel
          for breakfast.


          The remainder of the day is at leisure to further explore Varanasi on
          your own.
