A classic adventure in northern India. The journey includes the palaces of Jaipur, the immortal beauty of the Taj Mahal, the medieval temple town of Orchha, the erotic statues of Khajuraho and sunrise over the sacred Ganges. A boat ride on the Ganges at dawn, when it is full of pilgrims making their sin-cleansing dip in the holy river, is an amazing experience.

### Highlights:
* Cycling and visiting Amber Fort in Jaipur
* An early-morning trip to the Taj Mahal
* Huge forts, cenotaphs and temples in Orchha
* Beautiful (not just erotic) carvings in Khajuraho
* The holy city of Varanasi on the banks of the Ganges
