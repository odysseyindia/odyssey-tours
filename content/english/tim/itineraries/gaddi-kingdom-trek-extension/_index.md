          Dharamsala is a hill station that was established by the British in
          the mid-19th century. It stands on a spur of the Dhauladhar range
          amidst magnificent deodar and pine forests, tea gardens and beautiful
          hills. Today Upper Dharamsala, known as Mcleod Ganj, is the home of
          the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan Government-in-Exile. It is therefore
          the best base to explore Tibetan Buddhism, history and culture.

          Today, you first drive from McLeod Ganj to Satobari, the starting
          point of the trek. From Satobari, it is a downhill walk passing
          through Barnet village to Ghera village, where we have lunch near the
          river. From Ghera it is a steep ascent for about two hours to Kareri
          village (1,900m), a Gaddi tribal village of about 50 houses. We camp
          here near a small stream.

          This morning, an hour’s walk on a steep slope takes us to the Galu
          Devi temple from where we have good views of the Dhauladhar mountains
          and the valley. Another three hours of gradual ascent through mixed
          forests takes us to Triund, an alpine meadow situated atop a ridge.
          From Triund we have superb views of the snowy peaks of the Dhauladhars
          on one side and the Kangra valley on the other. We camp here for our
          night’s stay.

The Gaddi are a semi-nomadic shepherd tribe, who migrate with big herds of sheep and goats from the plains to the mountains during summer and vice versa during the winter. Starting from Dharamsala, this trekking trail takes you to several of their villages in the foothills of the Himalayas, a good way to get to know these gentle people. The trail also takes you to the beautiful alpine meadow of Triund, one of the biggest trekking highlights in Himachal Pradesh. We camp each night close to a small village beside a river, with the last night at the base of the Dhauladhar mountains, from where we have superb close views of the snow-covered peaks of the Himalayas.
