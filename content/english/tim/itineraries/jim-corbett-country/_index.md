          Delhi is practically two cities: New Delhi, the capital of India, and
          medieval Old Delhi. The old city centres around the Red Fort, which
          contains opulent palaces and impressive public buildings. Nearby is
          the magnificent Jama Masjid, India’s largest mosque. In New Delhi you
          can find India Gate - a war memorial arch, the impressive Parliament
          Building and Rashtrapati Bhawan, the residence of the President.
          Towards the South are Qutab Minar and Humayun’s Tomb, both World
          Heritage Sites.

        title: Morning tour of Old Delhi by Metro & rickshaw
        content: >-
          A half-day tour to Old Delhi using the modern Metro and the
          traditional cycle rickshaw. The Metro brings you to the heart of Old
          Delhi in just a few minutes, to visit the magnificent Jama Masjid
          mosque, India’s largest. You then use walk and ride cycle rickshaws
          through the fascinating maze of narrow streets around the main street
          of Old Delhi, Chandni Chowk, a bustling jumble of craft shops,
          traders, mosques and temples.


          At one end of this street is the huge Red Fort, the symbol of Delhi,
          which contains within it palaces and impressive public buildings.
          (Please note, though, that we will not go inside the Red Fort, because
          on this tour we concentrate on the narrow alleys and atmosphere of Old
          Delhi. However, you could arrange with your local guide to see the Red
          Fort at the end of your half-day tour). At the other end of Chandni
          Chowk is the colourful and aromatic Spice Market, the roof of which
          offers great views over Old Delhi. You can also visit the bustling and
          colourful Sikh Gurdwara.


          The rest of your day is at leisure. If you’d like to go shopping or
          explore a bit more after the tour, you can take the Metro to vibrant
          Connaught Place to enjoy the many restaurants and more modern shops.

        content: >-
          Today, you start bright and early, with a train and a four-hour drive
          that takes you to beautiful, secluded Binsar.


          The Binsar Valley is located in the Nanda Devi range of the Kumaon
          Himalayas, which are on the border between India and Nepal. Most
          visitors come for the 300-kilometre panorama of Himalayan peaks, and
          to visit the storied hill villages. Its location offers stunning views
          and makes the Binsar Valley a good base for bird-watching and walks
          through beautiful pine and deodar woods.


          The rest of your day is free to stroll around your hotel, go birding,
          or stay cosy by a crackling fire.

          A true hideaway in the Himalayan foothills, secluded and exceptionally

          from colonial times, converted into a relaxed, intimate resort with
          fabulous views and food in a setting of cedar, pine and rhododendron.


          A great spot if you like birding, easy treks or even just finding a
          good spot in the grounds or by the fire to enjoy a cuppa and a good
          book.

        title: Early-morning birding with a naturalist
        content: >-
          The birding walk at Mary Budden is called Hodgson’s Trail, in homage
          to Brian Houghton Hodgson, who served as the Assistant Commissioner in
          Kumaon in the early 19th century and whose seminal work was to
          identify a vast variety of birds in the Himalayas. Walk through the
          forest with a naturalist, in gentle pursuit of the nearly 179
          different species of birds found specifically in the forests of
          Binsar, tracing the paths taken by Mr. Hodgson.


          The estate offers plenty of other walks, which include picnic lunches
          or high tea, and meals in fun spots around the property - you can book
          these directly at the hotel, or just relax for the rest of the day.

          In Ramgarh, sightseeing is merely incidental and might defeat the
          purpose of your visit as you come here mainly to enjoy the peace and
          quiet and the beautiful scenery. The most you may want to do is to go
          on an easy walk in the neighborhood. Ramgarh also makes an idyllic
          base for visiting the nearby hill station of Nainital, but it’s best
          enjoyed at a very relaxed pace around your hotel.

          Today, you drive further down the hills to Corbett National Park. This
          was India’s first national park, and remains one of its finest. It is
          named after the legendary hunter Jim Corbett, who lived in this area
          for many years and wrote ‘The Man Eaters of Kumaon’. Extending over
          520 sq. km., the sanctuary is endowed with breathtaking natural beauty
          and an abundance of wildlife including tigers and elephants. The
          birdlife is especially impressive, with over 500 species. The best
          thing to do today is to explore the flora and fauna around the hotel
          in easy walks with the resident naturalists.

          hour safari, on a very scenic, undulating road to the Dhikala Forest
          Lodge in the centre of the park, with the on-board naturalist pointing
          out the wildlife. The hotel will provide a packed breakfast for the

          cooler winter months, plus various deer, crocodiles, elephants, and
          the rarely-seen leopards and tigers. Safaris take place in the early
          mornings and late afternoons, and you usually spend around 3 hours
          inside the park.

Jim Corbett was the best of the British colonials, a hunter-turned-conservationist who protected villagers from man-eating tigers and leopards, a primal terror we can scarcely imagine today. His hunting grounds in the Kumaon Himalayas are full of sleepy villages, beautiful views, amazing wildlife and a distinct, charming way of life. You get to learn about him and this land while looking for tigers and birds in Corbett National Park, and with stays in beautiful colonial-era mountain getaways in Ramgarh and Binsar. Enjoy foggy mornings, hot cups of tea, great opportunities for birding and tiger-spotting, and some of the most beautiful forests in India.
