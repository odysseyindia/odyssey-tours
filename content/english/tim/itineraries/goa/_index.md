          The former Portuguese colony of Goa is famous for its easy-going
          ambience, good food, and lovely climate. It boasts a coastline with
          beautiful beaches; palm-fringed rivers, lush scenery with paddy
          fields, mango groves and whitewashed villas. Evidence of its glorious
          past can be seen in the unique Indo-Portuguese style of its
          magnificent baroque churches, its stately ancestral mansions and its
          historic forts.

          Partake in a vivid narrative of Goan cuisine in this private trail
          through Panjim, where you discover feni, an olfactory overload of a
          liquor distilled from cashew fruit and palm sap, and hear stories
          about Goan cuisine, with its Portuguese, Indian and East African
          influences. This trail, more a cultural experience than a typical pub
          crawl, includes some of the most iconic places for Goan food, paired
          with the best feni and feni-based cocktails.

The little state of Goa is one of India’s most popular destinations, with a fun vibe, great beaches and excellent food. However, tempting as it is to just lie on the beach, there’s more to Goa. Its colonial past under the Portuguese has given it architecture and urban design unlike anywhere else in India, and this is worth exploring too.
