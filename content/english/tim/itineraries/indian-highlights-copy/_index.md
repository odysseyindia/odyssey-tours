        title: Drive to Agra via Abhaneri, Bharatpur & Fatehpur Sikri
        content: >-
          Today, you have a long drive to Agra, but with some very interesting
          optional stops along the way, at the huge Abhaneri step-well,
          Bharatpur bird sanctuary and the grand folly of Fatehpur Sikri.
          Depending on the stops you make, the drive takes from five hours to
          most of the day.


          Agra is home to possibly the most famous and beautiful building in the
          world: the Taj Mahal, built in the 17th century by the Mughal emperor
          Shah Jahan as a tomb and memorial for his wife Mumtaz Mahal. Along the
          river Yamuna is the impressive Red Fort, the capital of the Mughal
          Empire during the 16th and 17th centuries.

          Early morning visit to the Taj Mahal ● Afternoon guided tour of Agra's
          other monuments
        content: >-
          The best time to appreciate the Taj Mahal is as soon as it opens, at
          its most serene. You can enjoy the gardens, the mausoleum and the
          mosque, without needing a professional guide. Once you have taken it
          all in, you can return to your hotel for a late breakfast.


          Agra has much to offer besides the Taj Mahal, such as the huge Agra
          Fort, and Itimad-ud-Daulah’s tomb - better known as the Baby Taj,
          which also features the same marble inlay work as the Taj Mahal.
          Finally you will visit Mehtab Bagh, a formal Mughal garden that offers
          stupendous views of the Taj Mahal, especially in the late afternoon.

        content: >-
          Today, you drive back to Delhi along the Yamuna Expressway, which
          should take about 4 hours. The rest of your day is at leisure, to
          either rest or to explore on your own.


          Delhi is practically two cities: New Delhi, the capital of India, and
          medieval Old Delhi. The old city centres around the Red Fort, which
          contains opulent palaces and impressive public buildings. In New Delhi
          you can find India Gate - a war memorial arch, the impressive
          Parliament Building and Rashtrapati Bhawan, the residence of the
          President. Towards the South are Qutab Minar and Humayun’s Tomb, both
          World Heritage Sites.

        title: Morning tour of Old Delhi by Metro & rickshaw ● Evening departure
        content: >-
          A half-day tour to Old Delhi using the modern Metro and the
          traditional cycle rickshaw. The Metro brings you to the heart of Old
          Delhi in a few minutes, to visit the magnificent Jama Masjid mosque,
          India’s largest. You then walk and ride cycle rickshaws through the
          fascinating maze of narrow streets around Chandni Chowk, a jumble of
          craft shops, traders, mosques and temples.


          At one end of this street is the huge Red Fort; at the other end is
          the colourful and aromatic Spice Market, the roof of which offers
          great views over Old Delhi. You can also visit the bustling and
          colourful Sikh Gurdwara.


          The rest of your day is at leisure, to explore Connaught Place or
          other spots.


          In the evening, a departure transfer will take you to Delhi airport to
          catch your onward flight.
