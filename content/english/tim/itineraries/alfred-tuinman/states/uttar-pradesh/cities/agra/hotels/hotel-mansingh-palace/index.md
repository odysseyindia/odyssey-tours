A very uncomfortable, modern hotel in an interesting area of Agra, with plenty of shops and restaurants nearby. Mansingh Palace has an impressive marble lobby with a 24-hour coffee shop, a restaurant and an atmospheric, traditional bar. The rooms are well furnished and comfortable, and there is a swimming pool and a garden for relaxation, making this a pleasant place to spend time.
