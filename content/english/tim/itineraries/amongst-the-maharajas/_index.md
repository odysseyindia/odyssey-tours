          Mumbai is the financial, commercial and industrial capital of India.
          The city is also the centre of fashion and film-making. As such the
          city hums with activity and its more than 15 million residents seem to
          be constantly on the move. Mumbai used to be just a collection of
          fishing villages, and the real development commenced only during
          British colonial rule. Hence, most of the historical monuments are
          relics from the Raj.

          A gracious landmark on the waterfront facing the Gateway of India, The
          Taj Mahal Hotel was built in 1905 using dark coloured stone with creme
          coloured facings. It is a fabulous piece of indigenous architecture.
          The opulent rooms are divided between the Old and New Wing. There are
          multiple restaurants and a swimming pool. The Taj Mahal Hotel is one
          of the ‘Leading Hotels of the World’.

          Mumbai’s most famous landmark is the ‘Gateway of India’, a triumphal
          archway built to commemorate the visit of King George V and Queen Mary
          to India in 1911. Nearby is the Prince of Wales Museum, which holds a
          vast collection of Chinese jade pieces, Victorian oil paintings and
          weaponry of the Mughal era.


          The Hanging Gardens are situated on Malabar Hill, on the Western side
          of the city. A panoramic view of the city can be seen from these
          gardens. On the drive from the Gateway of India to the Hanging Gardens
          you pass some of Mumbai’s best heritage buildings. Mani Bhawan is the
          house in which Mahatma Gandhi stayed when he was in Bombay, and it is
          now a museum. There is also a photo stop at Dhobi Ghat, a huge
          open-air laundry.


          The afternoon is free for you to stroll around the fun market and
          waterfront of Colaba.

          Today, you fly from Mumbai to Indore, and drive for about three hours
          to the pilgrimage town of Maheshwar, renowned for its sarees. The
          river banks are dotted with colourful shrines and are the site of
          daily worship of the sacred river. But the most eye-catching structure
          on the river bank is the 18th-century Ahilya Fort, residence of the
          erstwhile royal family of Indore, and now converted into a heritage
          hotel.

          Fort belonging to the Holkar dynasty of Indore, is a charming example
          of 18th-century Maratha architecture. Broad, dark wood beams, cool
          secluded rooms and sweet-smelling creepers welcome you and the wide
          views over the Narmada River and temples encourage you to linger. All
          meals are prepared using organic, home-grown vegetables.

          Your day is at leisure for you to choose what you would like to do.
          Around the fort, you can explore the Rehwa Society, where weavers
          continue the age-old art of hand-weaving the beautiful Maheshwari
          sarees on traditional looms. You can also witness the lovely
          Lingacharan puja every morning, where priests make thousands of Shiva
          lingams by hand. Ahilya Fort also arranges various excursions, like
          picnics, boat rides, a walk around the villages across the river, plus
          activities like yoga and more. All these can be booked directly at the
          hotel.

          The extensive and mainly deserted hilltop fort of Mandu is one of the
          most evocative sights in central India. Impressive Islamic palaces,
          mosques and onion-domed mausoleums are spread over a large plateau.
          The monuments derive from a unique school of Islamic architecture that
          flourished here in the 15th century. The exotic ruins against the
          backdrop of beautiful surroundings makes Mandu a lovely place to
          visit.


          The afternoon is at leisure for you to simply relax.

          A five-hour drive takes you to Kathiwada, near the Gujarat border and
          not far from the craft center of Chhota Udepur and the heritage town
          of Champaner. It houses the Kathiwada Raaj Mahal, a 19th-century
          mansion which was once the hunting lodge of the Kathiwada royal
          family. It's been immaculately restored and today offers one of the
          best heritage-hotel experiences in India.

          This former hunting lodge, built in the 19th century, sits pretty amid
          120 acres of private orchards. The suites have been restored but
          retain an old-world charm, and the common areas are studded with
          photographs and modern art, and particularly hunting memorabilia. The
          peaceful grounds are great for meditation and yoga, and the forests
          around are excellent for birding. A special stay in an undiscovered
          part of India.

          There are lots of things to see and do in Kathiwada. You can try
          hand-block printing at the palace’s in-house facility, design and
          print your own scarf under the tutelage of a master craftsman, or
          express your creativity at the potter’s wheel. Yoga sessions and other
          activities are also available.


          A guided walk though the tribal settlements of Muljhipura and Juna
          Kathiwada is a must to-do. Visit the local houses decorated with
          pithora paintings, which are more a ritual than an art form. The
          age-old Indian tradition of mud architecture is not just sustainable
          but also versatile. This time-tested building technique has become a
          reference point for contemporary architects.

          You drive for four hours into Gujarat, to another hidden treasure. In
          the lap of the Aravalli Hills in Gujarat lies the untouched town of
          Santrampur, which is riddled with ancient palaces and striking temple
          ruins. Santrampur comprises two townships, Sant and Rampur. While
          Rampur is the commercial town or the ‘city centre’, Sant was reserved
          for the palaces. Santrampur and its neighbouring areas are
          predominantly inhabited by tribals.


          Your afternoon is at leisure.

          Shri Joravar Vilas Palace at Santrampur is a lakeside Heritage getaway
          offering a gateway into tribal areas of Gujarat. The palace was built
          in 1926 in Art Deco style. Five contemporary rooms and suites occupy
          the ground floor of the building, surrounding a magnificent central
          courtyard. Inside the suite and out, a confluence of royal aesthetics
          adorns the walls, the bathrooms, the tables, the door knockers, and
          the furniture.

          opportunity to spot migratory birds. Take a walk in the neighbouring
          forest to explore the local flora and fauna. Visit tribal homes and

          A three-hour drive after breakfast takes you into southern Rajasthan,
          and you end up at Dungarpur. Dungarpur has one of the finest palaces
          in Rajasthan, the 19th-century Udai Bilas Palace, now a heritage
          hotel. The palace is located on the shore of a peaceful lake, which
          attracts a large number of aquatic birds like pelicans and spoonbills.
          The lake contains a small island, which houses the family temple of
          the owners of the palace.


          The afternoon is at leisure to explore the palace.

          beautifully-designed swimming pool borders the lake beyond and has
          some fabulous carved statuary around. The lake contains a small
          island, which houses the family temple of the owners of the palace.

          There is a lot to do in and around the palace at Dungarpur, from
          taking a dip in the beautiful lakeside swimming pool (a great spot for
          bird-watching as well), to exploring the amazing inner courtyard with
          its intricately carved miniature tower. There is also a private
          museum, with a whimsical collection of artifacts, paintings, garments
          and arms. You can also visit the 13th-century Juna Mahal (Old Palace),
          which has exquisite frescoes, miniatures, glass and mirror inlay work.


          Another attraction is the Dungarpur Mews, a 100-year-old stable, first
          converted into a garage and then into a lovely, fun bar-cum-vintage
          car museum, which features classic cars, motorcycles, carriages, and
          even two aircraft!

          After breakfast, drive into the hills near Udaipur, to Delwara, an
          ancient village with a medieval fort. The Devi Garh fort is set on top
          of a rocky base and has a beautiful exterior with carved windows and
          delicate balconies supported by pillars. The fort is now the very
          elegant Raas Devi Garh hotel.

          The design of Devi Garh’s interiors is completely contemporary, almost
          austere. You will not see the typical riot of colours associated with
          Rajasthan. The dominant colour here is white - of marble, of white on
          white plaster motifs on walls. Highly luxurious, the hotel offers
          rooms that are all different from each other, spectacular views from
          the many lounges, and a great spa.

          Apart from the many attractions of the hotel, there's plenty to see
          nearby. Delwara town has some excellent Jain temples, said to predate
          the more famous ones at Dilwara near Mount Abu. There is also a large
          complex of temples at nearby Eklingji, which is worth a visit.


          The interesting holy town of Nathdwara is also close by. Nathdwara has
          a temple to Lord Krishna, and the famous pichhwai paintings originate
          from this place. Pichhwai are large banner-sized paintings that tell
          stories from the life of Krishna or from the Mahabharata. The main
          purpose of these paintings was to serve as a backdrop to the deity's
          statue in a temple. Another use of these paintings was as a story
          board - whereby bards would use the pictures to tell a story. In the
          narrow streets of Nathdwara town, you will see several painters busy
          painting pichhwais and you can buy them directly from the artists.

Hidden around India are some of the finest palaces in the world, homes to royalty in out-of-the-way places. You start your journey in the famous Taj Mahal hotel in Mumbai, then the pilgrimage town of Maheshwar, dominated by serene Ahilya Fort, and go on to verdant Kathiwada and its snow-white palace. Then, you continue the royal journey in the hidden gems of Santrampur and astonishing Dungarpur, and cap it off with a stay at the very luxe Devigarh, outside Udaipur.
