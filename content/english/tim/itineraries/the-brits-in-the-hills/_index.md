          Delhi is practically two cities: New Delhi, the capital of India, and
          medieval Old Delhi. The old city centres around the Red Fort, which
          contains opulent palaces and impressive public buildings. Nearby is
          the magnificent Jama Masjid, India’s largest mosque. In New Delhi you
          can find India Gate - a war memorial arch, the impressive Parliament
          Building and Rashtrapati Bhawan, the residence of the President.
          Towards the South are Qutab Minar and Humayun’s Tomb, both World
          Heritage Sites.

        title: Morning tour of Old Delhi by Metro & rickshaw
        content: >-
          A half-day tour to Old Delhi using the modern Metro and the
          traditional cycle rickshaw. The Metro brings you to the heart of Old
          Delhi in just a few minutes, to visit the magnificent Jama Masjid
          mosque, India’s largest. You then use walk and ride cycle rickshaws
          through the fascinating maze of narrow streets around the main street
          of Old Delhi, Chandni Chowk, a bustling jumble of craft shops,
          traders, mosques and temples.


          At one end of this street is the huge Red Fort, the symbol of Delhi,
          which contains within it palaces and impressive public buildings.
          (Please note, though, that we will not go inside the Red Fort, because
          on this tour we concentrate on the narrow alleys and atmosphere of Old
          Delhi. However, you could arrange with your local guide to see the Red
          Fort at the end of your half-day tour). At the other end of Chandni
          Chowk is the colourful and aromatic Spice Market, the roof of which
          offers great views over Old Delhi. You can also visit the bustling and
          colourful Sikh Gurdwara.


          The rest of your day is at leisure. If you’d like to go shopping or
          explore a bit more after the tour, you can take the Metro to vibrant
          Connaught Place to enjoy the many restaurants and more modern shops.

          Today, an early-morning train takes you through the wheat and corn
          fields of the Punjab, ending at Patiala. This was a princely state
          under the Raj, ruled by an extravagant family of Maharajas who were
          rather fond of constructing opulent buildings. Today, the grand
          monuments are all crumbling, but the old city, ringed by historic
          gates, retains a special feel with its bazaars, temples, fort and
          palaces. The city is also famous for the local measure of whisky – the
          Patiala peg – which is bigger than a standard peg that you get
          elsewhere.


          The afternoon is free for you to explore the palace and town on your
          own.

          The Baradari Palace was built in 1876 around a grand Baradari (an open
          pavilion with 12 arches), also giving its name to the adjacent
          Baradari Garden. Once the construction was finished, the ruling family
          of Patiala moved out of their old residence, the Qila Mubarak, and
          shifted to the new sprawling garden-palace. It has now been converted
          into a heritage hotel.

          You head today into the beautiful Himalayan foothills, driving for
          five hours to the medieval village of Pragpur. With its wonderful
          cobbled streets and slate-roofed houses, it is the first notified
          heritage village in India. It nestles in one of the most spectacular
          areas of the Kangra valley, south of Dharamsala. Kangra was the most
          important kingdom in the West Himalayas after Kashmir and is said to
          have existed since Vedic times. Steeped in history, Kangra is world
          famous for the Kangra school of painting.


          The afternoon is free for you to soak up the atmosphere of this little
          town and the Judge’s Court.

          and carp to catch. Originally built as a home in 1918 to commemorate a
          son’s graduation from law college in England, Judge’s Court has only a
          few rooms, each unique, housed in different buildings on the property
          and some even in a 300-year-old cottage in the village.

        content: >-
          Vijai Lal, who traces his family’s presence in Pragpur back several
          generations, has made every effort to preserve the village and his own
          heritage. This impetus to village crafts and architecture has resulted
          in the revival of skills like weaving and silver work and the
          conservation of the mud walls, original plaster-work and slate roofs
          that adorn the Pragpur houses.


          Other sightseeing options include the exploring the ruins of the
          medieval Kangra Fort and visiting the wetlands of the Maharana Pratap
          Sagar bird sanctuary.

        content: >-
          Today, you take the scenic Kangra-Palampur toy train: one of the last
          narrow-gauge railways built in India, it mainly gets locals from small
          towns to temples, through spectacular landscapes in the Himalayan
          foothills. Think deep gorges, pine forests, fields of yellow mustard.
          Think undulating tea gardens, jade rivers, mud-walled houses in ochre
          and green, ears of corn drying on slate roofs. Think pink cherry
          trees, red headscarves in a sea of green as women tend glistening
          fields of paddy. Then imagine the snowy white teeth of the Dhauladhar
          range - and you have the Kangra railway.


          After this miniature epic of a journey, you have the rest of the day
          free to enjoy your charming hotel.

          basic stone cottages and timber huts. However, the rooms are immensely
          comfortable with a simple, earthy feel. The highlight is the
          restorative coolness of the surroundings, and the fresh Himalayan air.

        content: >-
          The town of Palampur is situated in an idyllic valley of tea gardens,
          and is surrounded by hills covered with pine trees. The place enjoys a
          year-round pleasant climate and the pine scented air is said to have
          curative properties. Overlooking this town are the majestic
          Dhauladhars, whose peaks remain covered with snow for most of the
          year. There are several pleasant walks around the town. A short walk
          takes one to the awe-inspiring Bundla Chasm, which has a fall of over
          100 meters to the Bundla stream. The stream is a thin streak running
          over stony ground far below the cliff. During the monsoon season, it
          swells and rages madly over the entire width of the chasm taking
          stones and boulders along with it.


          Close to Palampur is the artists' village of Andretta. Created by
          Irishwoman Norah Richards, an affectionately remembered patron of
          Punjabi theatre, this ‘village’ has grown over the years to include
          writers, potters, and theatre artists.

          streams and dams to Shimla. This most famous of hill stations was
          developed by the British in the 19th century as the summer capital of
          India. Now the capital of Himachal Pradesh, the town has continued to
          grow, but at its heart remains the pedestrianised Mall, lined with
          colonial-era buildings.

          the surrounding hills.

          The best way to see Shimla is on foot, visiting the Botanical Gardens
          and lovely Viceregal Lodge, then descending along traffic-free roads
          through little forests and past colonial-era buildings to the Oberoi
          Cecil, Shimla’s grandest building. From here you can visit the Ridge,
          a large open area bordered by the peaceful Christ Church and Gaiety
          Theatre, and the Mall, Shimla’s colourful shopping hub, uniquely
          colonial and very different from a typical Indian bazaar.


          This is an easy, flexible walking tour that allows you as much or as
          little time at each spot, and even plenty of stops at cafes like the
          iconic Indian Coffee House.


          Your afternoon is at leisure to further explore Shimla on your own.
          There are many beautiful walks in the pine clad hills that surround
          Shimla, such as to the Jakhu temple, or to the former Viceregal Lodge
          with its botanical gardens.

The British Raj had its capitals in Calcutta and later New Delhi, but in the sweltering summers, they’d decamp with massive entourages to ‘hill stations’, which became charming little towns. Here, they set up pointy-steepled churches, narrow-gauge steam ‘toy trains’, stone cottages, and tea estates, all of which you can visit on this lovely tour of the Himalayan foothills. You’ll find Raj memorabilia everywhere, and plenty of stories, as well as delightful accommodation and amazing views.
