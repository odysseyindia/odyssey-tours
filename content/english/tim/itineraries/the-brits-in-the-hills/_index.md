          Delhi is practically two cities: New Delhi, the capital of India, and
          medieval Old Delhi. The old city centres around the Red Fort, which
          contains opulent palaces and impressive public buildings. Nearby is
          the magnificent Jama Masjid, India’s largest mosque. In New Delhi you
          can find India Gate - a war memorial arch, the impressive Parliament
          Building and Rashtrapati Bhawan, the residence of the President.
          Towards the South are Qutab Minar and Humayun’s Tomb, both World
          Heritage Sites.

        title: Half day tour of Old Delhi by metro & rickshaw
        content: >-
          A half-day tour to Old Delhi using the modern Metro and the
          traditional cycle rickshaw. The Metro brings you to the heart of Old
          Delhi in just a few minutes, to visit the magnificent Jama Masjid
          mosque, India’s largest. You then use walk and ride cycle rickshaws
          through the fascinating maze of narrow streets around the main street
          of Old Delhi, Chandni Chowk, a bustling jumble of craft shops,
          traders, mosques and temples. At one end of this street is the huge
          Red Fort, the symbol of Delhi, which contains within it palaces and
          impressive public buildings. At the other is the colourful and
          aromatic Spice Market, the roof of which offers great views over Old
          Delhi. You can also visit the bustling and colourful Sikh Gurdwara.
          Whilst returning to the hotel by Metro at the end of the tour, you may
          choose to stop off at Connaught Place to enjoy the many restaurants
          and more modern shops. Note: We will not be visiting the interior of
          the Red Fort because on this tour we concentrate on the narrow alleys
          and atmosphere of Old Delhi. However, you could arrange with your
          local guide to see the Red Fort at the end of your half-day tour.
          Please also note that the Red Fort is closed on Mondays and national
          holidays.

        content: >-
          Patiala was a princely state under the Raj, ruled by an extravagant
          family of Maharajas who were rather fond of constructing opulent
          buildings. Today, the grand monuments are all crumbling, but the old
          city, ringed by historic gates, retains a special feel with its
          bazaars, temples, fort and palaces. The city is also famous for the
          local measure of whisky – the Patiala peg – which is bigger than a
          standard peg that you get elsewhere.

          The Baradari Palace was built in 1876 around a grand Baradari (an open
          pavilion with 12 arches), also giving its name to the adjacent
          Baradari Garden. Once the construction was finished, the ruling family
          of Patiala moved out of their old residence, the Qila Mubarak, and
          shifted to the new sprawling garden-palace. It has now been converted
          into a heritage hotel.

          The medieval village of Pragpur has wonderful cobbled streets and
          slate-roofed houses - it is the first notified heritage village in
          India. It nestles in one of the most spectacular areas of the Kangra
          valley, south of Dharamsala. Kangra was the most important kingdom in
          the West Himalayas after Kashmir and is said to have existed since
          Vedic times. Steeped in history, Kangra is world famous for the Kangra
          school of painting.

          rustic heritage village of Pragpur at its very doorstep, birds to
          watch and carp to catch. Originally built as a home in 1918 to
          commemorate a son’s graduation from law college in England, Judge’s
          Court has only a few rooms, each unique, housed in different buildings
          on the property and some even in a 300 year old cottage in the
          village.

        content: >-
          Vijai Lal, who traces his family’s presence in Pragpur back several
          generations, has made every effort to preserve the village and his own
          heritage. This impetus to village crafts and architecture has resulted
          in the revival of skills like weaving and silver work and the
          conservation of the mud walls, original plasterwork and slate roofs
          that adorn the Pragpur houses. Other sightseeing options include the
          possibility to explore the ruins of the medieval Kangra Fort and
          visiting the wetlands of the Maharana Pratap Sagar bird sanctuary.

          The town of Palampur came into being when a British doctor introduced
          the tea bush from Almora in 1849. The bush thrived and so did the town
          which became a focus of the European tea estate owners. Nowadays
          Palampur is a lovely town surrounded by tea gardens and pine trees.
          Behind the town stand the majestic high ranges of the Dhauladhars,
          whose peaks remain covered in snow for most part of the year.

          The town of Palampur is situated in an idyllic valley of tea gardens,
          and is surrounded by hills covered with pine trees. The place enjoys a
          year-round pleasant climate and the pine scented air is said to have
          curative properties. Overlooking this town are the majestic
          Dhauladhars, whose peaks remain covered with snow for most of the
          year. There are several pleasant walks around the town. A short walk
          from here takes one to the awe inspiring Bundla Chasm which has a fall
          of over 100 meters to the Bundla stream. The stream is a thin streak
          running over stony ground far below the cliff. During the monsoon
          season, it swells and rages madly over the entire width of the chasm
          taking stones and boulders along with it. Close to Palampur is the
          artists' village of Andretta. Created by Norah Richards, an
          affectionately remembered patron of Punjabi theatre, this ‘village’
          has grown over the years to include writers, potters, and theatre
          artists.

          Himachal Pradesh, the town has continued to grow, but at its heart
          remains the Mall, lined with colonial-era buildings. There are many
          beautiful walks in the pine clad hills that surround Shimla, such as
          to the Jakhu temple, or to the former Viceregal Lodge with its
          botanical gardens.

The British Raj had its capitals in Calcutta and later New Delhi, but in the sweltering summers, they&rsquo;d decamp with massive entourages to &lsquo;hill stations&rsquo;, which became charming little towns. Here, they set up pointy-steepled churches, narrow-gauge steam &lsquo;toy trains&rsquo;, stone cottages, and tea estates, all of which you can visit on this lovely tour of the Himalayan foothills. You&rsquo;ll find Raj memorabilia everywhere, and plenty of stories, as well as delightful accommodation and amazing views.
