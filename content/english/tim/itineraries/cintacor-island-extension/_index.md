          The port city of Karwar provides good connections for those travelling
          along the scenic coastal highway between Goa and Mangalore, or the
          equally good inland highway to Hampi via Hubli.


          Karwar is where you board a boat to the private island retreat of
          Cintacor.

          A short boat ride from the busy port city of Karwar gets you to this
          lovely retreat, with its airy cottages and total seclusion. The cabins
          are all spacious, and all offer views of the sea. There is an infinity
          pool, a restaurant, a casual bar and a lounge with a library, as if
          having an island largely to yourself wasn’t enough.

An astonishing thing: a completely private island in bustling India! At this private island in the Arabian Sea, just off the coast of Karnataka, you can go on and vegetate, or take part in a whole host of activities. You’ll love the comfortable cabins, the stunning views, and most of all, the seclusion. A very different side to India, and a great end to a trip.
