          Delhi is practically two cities: New Delhi, the capital of India, and
          medieval Old Delhi. The old city centres around the Red Fort, which
          contains opulent palaces and impressive public buildings. Nearby is
          the magnificent Jama Masjid, India’s largest mosque.


          In New Delhi you can find India Gate - a war memorial arch, the
          impressive Parliament Building and Rashtrapati Bhawan, the residence
          of the President. Towards the South are Qutab Minar and Humayun’s
          Tomb, both World Heritage Sites.

          the city.

        title: Morning guided tour of New Delhi
        content: >-
          New Delhi has a number of attractions, like Humayun’s Tomb, a
          sandstone mausoleum in the authentic Mughal style - the Taj Mahal,
          built much later, follows a similar style of architecture. Nearby you
          can see India Gate, the Parliament Buildings, the Lodhi Gardens, the
          Lotus Temple, the President’s House, and the Sikh temple, Gurudwara
          Bangla Sahib. However, Delhi is huge and traffic is usually heavy, and
          half a day is not enough to see all of the attractions, so it is best
          to discuss with your guide which sights you might wish to visit.


          The afternoon is free for you to relax or explore further on your own.

        title: Amritsar
        content: >-
          Starting early in the morning, a comfortable train journey takes you
          through the fertile countryside of the Punjab to Amritsar, near the
          Indo-Pakistan border. This 400-year-old city of the Golden Temple is
          the paramount seat of Sikh history and culture.


          More recently, it has also become known for the unique border-closing
          ceremony that takes place every evening at nearby Wagah, at the only
          open land border between India and Pakistan.


          The afternoon is free for you to wander around by yourself to the
          Golden Temple if you wish, always a lovely experience - though you
          will have a proper guided tour the next day.

          This lovely heritage spa resort is located in the heart of Amritsar.
          The large lawns and ancient trees create a peaceful, idyllic space.
          The property is furnished with antiques and knick-knacks, and there
          are many delightful lounges, terraces, and places to relax. Each room
          is individually decorated, and most have an inviting patio or balcony
          overlooking the gardens. There is an inviting in-house spa as well.

        content: >-
          Amritsar’s highlights are clustered in the attractive area around the
          Golden Temple. The Partition Museum in the historic Town Hall tells
          the story of India’s independence and the tragically violent division
          of India and Pakistan. Jallianwala Bagh is a garden dedicated to those
          massacred here by the British in 1919.


          The big draw, of course, is visiting the serene Golden Temple, capped
          by the communal, free meal offered to thousands every day.

          The daily border closing ceremony at the Wagah Border between India
          and Pakistan is extraordinary street theatre. Crowds assemble in large
          stands on both sides of the border, with much chanting, singing of
          patriotic songs, and even dancing, with a faux-aggressive ceremony.


          The event is choreographed, and the atmosphere is actually that of a
          big party!

          A six-hour drive today takes you past fields and then suddenly up into
          the lovely Himalayan foothills to Dharamsala, a hill station
          established by the British in the mid-19th century. It stands on a
          spur of the Dhauladhar range amidst magnificent deodar and pine
          forests, tea gardens and beautiful hills.


          Today Upper Dharamsala, known as Mcleod Ganj, is the home of the Dalai
          Lama and the Tibetan Government-in-Exile. It is therefore the best
          base to explore Tibetan Buddhism, history and culture.


          After you arrive, your afternoon is free to stroll around on your own.

          Norling Guesthouse is located within the Norbulingka Institute in
          Lower Dharamsala, a 20-minute drive from McLeod Ganj. This is a warm,
          cosy place with lovely Tibetan art, and the beautiful grounds of the
          Institute and temple around it, with a peaceful garden café.


          A comfortable guesthouse, this intimate place provides access to the
          sacred traditional art forms of Thangka painting, applique work and
          wood and metal work that are practised in the institute.

        content: >-
          There is much to see in and around Dharamsala. On a full-day guided
          tour you can visit the Dalai Lama’s temple and join Tibetan pilgrims
          on their traditional “kora” (circuit of the temple complex). You can
          see the buildings that make up the Tibetan Parliament, including the
          library/museum. Surprisingly close to the town, you can walk through
          tea plantations and visit a functioning tea factory.


          You can enjoy extensive views of the hills and mountains above
          Dharamsala, and take a short walk through a traditional village
          belonging to the Gaddi people, and visit the 19th-century St John in
          the Wilderness church.


          In Lower Dharamsala you can visit the fascinating Norbulingka
          Institute, a large complex dedicated to the preservation of Tibetan
          culture, with many workshops producing Tibetan handicrafts, a
          colourful temple.

          You have the morning at leisure to poke around the Norbulingka
          Institute.


          In the afternoon, you take a three-hour drive down the Kangra valley
          to Pathankot, to board an overnight train to the holy city of
          Rishikesh.

        content: >-
          The River Ganges leaves the Himalayan foothills and enters the plains
          at Rishikesh. It is therefore an important place to Hindus and for
          Hindu practices, and so has many temples, ashrams, and yoga
          institutes. The city itself is busy and congested, but a much more
          tranquil atmosphere can be found on, and around, the banks of the
          river. Rishikesh is easily explored on your own, on foot.


          After your overnight train journey, it’s a great idea to just enjoy
          your lovely hotel for the day.

          A small, secluded resort outside Rishikesh, the Glass House on the
          Ganges is set in a lychee orchard with a garden of tropical plants
          which attracts rare birds and butterflies. The rooms are either in the
          main block, fronted by a pillared veranda with relaxing planters'
          chairs, or in cottages in the lush gardens of mango, lychee, and
          citrus trees and tropical plants.


          Plenty of activities are available at the hotel, including yoga
          classes and its own evening aarti ceremony.

        content: >-
          Today is a free day to explore Rishikesh on your own. You’ll find
          temples at every corner of the city and there are many ashrams
          offering courses on meditation, yoga and Hindu philosophy. You can
          also take a tour of the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi Ashram where The Beatles
          composed 40 songs in 3 weeks in 1968.


          The narrow streets of Rishikesh are full with colourful shops selling
          a variety of items ranging from handlooms to travel bags to
          traditional clothing. Plenty of cafes have sprung up around the city
          where you can sip on a hot coffee and watch the world go by. In the
          evening worshippers congregate for the Ganga aarti with diyas (earthen
          lamps), garlands and chanting of mantras (ancient sacred texts), a
          fascinating spectacle to watch.

          holiest places in India, and one of the oldest living cities in the
          world. It’s made up of a fascinating and colourful collection of
          sadhus (holy men), pundits (priests), pilgrims, guides, and beggars.


          The heart of the city is Har Ki Pauri, a bathing ‘ghat’ at the banks
          of the Ganges, and the lovely, bustling market around it. Every
          evening, the Ganges comes alive with a magical ceremony, the aarti.

          pleasant ambience, with the major ghats and religious activities
          clustered around Har-ki-Pauri. Non-Hindus are not allowed onto this
          particular ghat, but the island opposite it, topped by a clock tower,
          provides an excellent vantage point. You can ask the hotel to send a
          guide along with you to visit this place.


          In the evening, it’s fun to stroll around the markets and re-visit the
          aarti if you like.
