        title: Varanasi
        content: >-
          Today, you have a flight to Varanasi, one of the most important places
          for Hindus: it’s believed that anyone who dies here will be liberated
          from the cycle of reincarnation, and bathing in the Ganges River is
          said to cleanse away all sins.


          The fascinating thing is that the rituals are conducted openly along
          the many riverside ghats, which are used for everything from bathing
          to burning the bodies of the dead. It is not the easiest city to
          appreciate as it is noisy and crowded, but it is certainly one of the
          most memorable places you will ever visit.


          Varanasi’s riverside ghats are fabulous for exploring on your own -
          the rest of the day is free for you to walk around and absorb the
          unique atmosphere.

          paintings and religious items decorate the many lounges and terraces.
          The overall effect is of peaceful contemplation, offering a more in
          depth understanding of the history and culture of this pilgrimage
          city.

        content: >-
          Your guide meets you at the hotel before sunrise, so you can watch the
          amazing Subah-e-Benares spectacle, which takes place on Varanasi’s
          waterfront every morning. The principal attraction of Varanasi is the
          long string of bathing ghats by the river, where pilgrims make their
          sin-cleansing dip in the holy river and on which bodies are cremated.
          A boat ride on the Ganges at dawn, when it is full of pilgrims, is an
          amazing experience, and your guide can explain the various rituals
          taking place.


          Leaving the boat after passing the most important ghats, you then
          continue on foot for a fascinating exploration of the narrow lanes of
          the Bengali Tola area, one of the oldest continuously-inhabited places
          on earth, passing countless small temples, shrines, and traditional
          shops. Your guide will provide a unique insight into this most
          fascinating of cities. At the end of the walk, you return to the hotel
          for breakfast.

        content: >-
          To the north of Varanasi, Sarnath is a peaceful contrast to the chaos
          of the city. It was here that Gautama Buddha preached his first sermon
          2,500 years ago. The site is sacred to Buddhists and is now a major
          place of pilgrimage.


          Within a peaceful park are stupas and other ruins from the time of the
          Buddha. There is also a temple with paintings depicting the life of
          the Buddha on the walls. The Archeological Museum is worth a visit to
          view unique Buddhist masterpieces, and also on display is the famous
          Ashoka column, which features on all Indian banknotes.

          Today, you drive about six hours to Bodh Gaya, a sacred place for
          Buddhists from all over the world. It was here that Prince Siddhartha
          Gautama attained enlightenment beneath a bodhi tree and became the
          Buddha. On this sacred spot stands the majestic Mahabodhi Temple.


          Pilgrims from many lands have built their own temples and monasteries,
          offering meditation courses varying from a week to a month. The
          International Meditation Centre also holds courses.

        content: >-
          Bodh Gaya is not so much a town as a true Buddhist working centre
          surrounded by farmland and rural villages. The main site is the famous
          Mahabodhi temple built at the spot where the Buddha became
          enlightened. During the last century, Bodh Gaya has been rejuvenated
          by overseas Buddhists, who have built an array of monasteries, temples
          and shrines. They attract pilgrims to study, meditate and absorb the
          ambience.


          Your afternoon is at leisure to further explore on your own.

        content: >-
          Today, you drive to the important sites at Rajgir and Nalanda.


          Surrounded by rugged, forested hills, the town of Rajgir is important
          for Buddhists as well as Jains as the founders of both religions spent
          many years meditating and preaching here. Gridhrakuta (“Vulture’s
          Peak”) is a site much venerated by Buddhists, as this is where the
          Buddha delivered many important sermons. Two rock-cut caves here were
          a favourite retreat of the Buddha.


          Nalanda was the site of the world’s earliest university, where 2,000
          teachers and 10,000 students from all over the Buddhist world lived
          and studied from the 5th century BC till the 12th century AD. Much
          still lies unexcavated, but even so, Nalanda’s scale and grandeur is
          evident from the ruins of the stupas, temples and monasteries. There
          is also a small but interesting archaeological museum of finds from
          the site.


          You end the day at the ancient city of Patna. Then known as
          Pataliputra, Patna was renowned as one of the great cities of Asia,
          but today it is a congested urban sprawl, stretching along the banks
          of the Ganges. Divided in two by the large open Maidan, the area to
          the west, laid out by the British, still boasts gracious mansions and
          administrative buildings, while the area to the east includes the
          crowded old city with its bazaars and old mosques.

          After breakfast you drive to the archaeological site of Vaishali. This
          dates back to the 6th century BC when it was a flourishing city,
          reputedly one of the first democratic republics. This is where the
          Buddha preached his last sermon and announced his approaching Nirvana.
          Vaishali today is a small village surrounded by banana and mango
          groves and rice fields. At the site of Buddha’s last sermon, the
          Emperor Ashoka erected a pillar which still stands, surrounded by
          ruined monasteries.


          You continue to Kushinagar, where the Buddha died and was cremated,
          and passed into nirvana. A modern temple, with a large “Reclining
          Buddha” statue, has been built to commemorate this, and various
          monuments relating to the Buddha’s last days can be seen. In recent
          years, new temples have been constructed by Chinese, Sri Lankan, Thai
          and Japanese Buddhists alongside the ruins of ancient monasteries and
          stupas.

          Today, you cross over into Nepal, and drive to Lumbini, which takes
          about five hours.


          Lumbini is one of the four main sites of pilgrimage for Buddhists, as
          it is the birthplace of Gautama Buddha, the founder of Buddhism.
          Lumbini is a small, tranquil place with a spiritual atmosphere in
          keeping with its religious significance. From early morning to early
          evening, pilgrims from various countries perform chanting and
          meditation at the site.

          Today, you cross back into India, first visiting the Buddha’s
          birthplace of Kapilavastu.


          Buddhist texts claim that Kapilavastu was the childhood home of
          Siddhartha Gautama where he spent the first 29 years of his life as a
          prince. He lived a luxurious, well-protected early life, got married
          and had a son named Rahul. According to the popular story, at one
          stage he saw an old man, a sick man and a dead body that made him
          question the meaning of life. He left everything he had in search of
          the meaning of life and the world got the Buddha.


          You then continue to Shravasti, which was one of the six largest
          cities in India during the time of Gautama Buddha (called Sahet-Mahet
          then). It is believed that he spent 25 years in the famous monasteries
          in Shravasti, mainly in the Jetavana monastery. It is also the place
          where he gave most of his discourses and instructions. The site of
          Jetavana monastery is the main pilgrim destination, with meditation
          and chanting mainly done at the Gandhakuti (Buddha’s hut) and the
          Anandabodhi tree.

Buddhism, believe it or not, is very much an Indian and Nepali phenomenon, with its origins in southern Nepal and the Indian states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. This is where the Buddha spent his life, learning, teaching and finally attaining Nirvana. Our tour takes you across the most important sites connected to the Buddha’s life, starting with the deer park at Sarnath, and going to Bodh Gaya, the monastery of Rajgir, the world’s first university at Nalanda and the temples of Vaishali. You cross into Nepal to visit Lumbini, and back into India to visit the Buddha’s birthplace at Kapilavastu and the important site of Shravasti. A wonderful tour whether you love Buddhism, or just history and archaeology.
