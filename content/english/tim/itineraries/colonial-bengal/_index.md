Bengal was once one of the richest parts of the world: the weaving town of Murshidabad alone was by itself 5% of the entire global economy! Bengal saw trading posts of the Danish and French before British domination, and was known for the opulent lives of its zamindars, or landed gentry. On this stylish tour, you get to explore a Bengal of days gone by, from atmospheric hotels in the storied city of Kolkata to a little Danish outpost in Serampore, past the site of a pivotal battle at Plassey, and to a gorgeous restored mansion in Murshidabad, your base for exploring a forgotten giant of world history.
