        content: >-
          The zamindars or landed gentry of Bengal led a lavish life full of
          wealth and privileges, building impressive mansions and temples. One
          such mansion is the Rajbari Bawali, over 250 years old and now a very
          comfortable heritage hotel, with gorgeous four-poster beds, etched
          mirrors and beautiful common areas (including a swimming pool) in an
          olde-worlde setting near the Hooghly River.

          After breakfast, visit the lovely old riverside French colony of
          Chandernagore, and the Dutch base of Fort Gustavus, at Chinsurah.


          You end the day after a short drive to Serampore, once a feudal town,
          then a Danish colony called Frederiknagore in the 18th and 19th
          centuries, then one of the places that saw the Bengal Renaissance when
          the British started India’s second ever railway line here. Today, it
          shows off a collection of colonial-era buildings among a variety of
          temples, a great place to check out Bengal’s amazing past.

          This 232-year-old two-storied structure by the banks of the Hooghly
          was a tavern and hotel where the Danes kept their flagstaff and
          cannons. It took around two years to restore the tavern to its former
          glory, and is now a very attractive hotel, with a cafe attached.
          Inside you’ll find a cosy colonial ambience and lovely, high-ceilinged
          rooms with the hotel’s pretty green shutters.

          The Danish settlement of Serampore lines the west bank of the Hooghly
          and was originally known as Frederiknagore, after the Danish monarch.
          Sold to the East India Company in 1845 Serampore developed into an
          important missionary town and printing centre. Today you can explore
          Serampore’s churches, temples and government buildings as well as the
          library of Serampore College which houses a rare collection of
          Sanskrit, Tibetan and Pali manuscripts.

        title: Murshidabad
        content: >-
          Today, you drive to the battlefield of Plassey, where the East India
          Company, under the command of Robert Clive, defeated the Nawab of
          Bengal, which laid the foundations for British rule in India. Robert
          Clive had bribed Mir Jafar who was an aspirant to the throne of Nawab
          of Bengal, and this betrayal ensured that the battle was over in a few
          hours with a decisive victory for the East India Company. You can
          visit the house and cemetery of Mir Jafar, a memorial of the darkest
          hour in the history of Bengal.


          After Plassey, you drive to Murshidabad, your base for the next three
          days. During the 18th century, Murshidabad became the capital of
          Bengal and the richest and most glamorous city of India, famous for
          silk, woven saris and muslin. The wealthiest merchants across India
          migrated to Murshidabad, later followed by British, French, Dutch and
          Danish trading companies. Having contributed 5 percent of the entire
          global economy in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, Murshidabad
          fell out of favour during British colonial rule, and is nowadays a
          slightly forgotten and hidden corner of India.

          The lovely Bari Kothi was built in the late 1700s, one of the most
          architecturally significant houses in the region, showcasing Greek,
          Roman and French architecture. Like other mansions in the region, it
          was abandoned for half a century, but restored in 2015 as a luxury
          heritage hotel, intended to employ local workers and craftsmen. The
          richly-decorated suites contain 150-year-old furniture, and each has
          its own history.

          Murshidabad is replete with history and the abandoned mosques,
          riverside mansions, grand tombs and crumbling palaces tell the story
          of an undivided Bengal. You explore Murshidabad on a heritage walk
          that includes the imposing Hazarduari Palace, neighbouring Imambara,
          17th century Jahankosha Canon, the 200 year old palace of wealthy
          financier Jagat Seth, Katra Mosque, Khoshbagh gardens and Kathgola,
          the home of a rich Jain merchant.


          The afternoon is at leisure to relax around the hotel, or book one of
          the many activities available.

          This morning you first visit the fascinating terracotta temples at
          Baranagar, then continue on to Cossimbazar which was once a Dutch
          colony and busy inland river port throughout the 18th and 19th
          centuries. During the early days of its existence, the English, Dutch
          and French all had factories in Cossimbazar and the town soon
          developed a reputation for silk, hosiery and ivory. A highlight is the
          palatial Cossimbazar Rajbari, still owned by the family which built
          it, and which today also houses an interesting museum.


          The afternoon is at leisure.

          An early train takes you to the culturally rich city of Kolkata.
          Kolkata was just a tiny village some 300 years ago. After the East
          India Company made it their first base in India, Calcutta became the
          seat of British power in India, and developed into an economic,
          industrial and political centre. At its chaotic heart is the Maidan, a
          huge green expanse with gardens, monuments and sporting facilities. At
          one end stands the Victoria Memorial, a white marble building that
          provides one of the best insights into British rule in India.

          is located near the very heart of the buzzing city. The rooms and
          suites are the ultimate in old-world elegance and luxury. The Oberoi
          Grand has three exclusive restaurants, a bar and a tea lounge. Other
          facilities include a 24-hour business centre, a swimming pool, a
          health club and a gym.

          Kolkata has fascinating street life and interesting colonial
          architecture. You drive via the historic St John’s Church to the
          famous Dalhousie Square, the commercial centre of the city, now
          renamed BBD Bagh. From here you continue to the bank of the river
          Hoogly, where you see the famous Howrah Bridge, which more than 5
          million people cross every day. You also visit the colourful flower
          market.


          Next is the Karmatuly area, where they make the huge effigies used in
          Kolkata’s most famous festival, Durga Puja. To the North of the centre
          you visit the exquisite, richly decorated Jain Temple before
          continuing to College Street book market, with its hundreds of
          bookstalls, and finally enjoy a coffee at the famous Indian Coffee
          House - still a gathering place for the city’s intellectuals.

Bengal was once one of the richest parts of the world: the weaving town of Murshidabad alone was by itself 5% of the entire global economy! Bengal saw trading posts of the Danish and French before British domination, and was known for the opulent lives of its zamindars, or landed gentry. On this stylish tour, you get to explore a Bengal of days gone by, from atmospheric hotels in the storied city of Kolkata to a little Danish outpost in Serampore, past the site of a pivotal battle at Plassey, and to a gorgeous restored mansion in Murshidabad, your base for exploring a forgotten giant of world history.
