        content: >-
          The twin city of Hyderabad-Secunderabad is a mixture of Muslim and
          Hindu cultures. Its history as the centre of Muslim India from the
          16th century can best be appreciated at the massive Golconda Fort.
          This mighty hilltop fortress saw frequent battles and remains one of
          the most impressive in India.


          The old city is found around the famous Charminar gate, and this
          predominantly Muslim area is fascinating to explore.

          West of Hyderabad lies the historic Golconda Fort, with its massive
          battlements winding up the dust-brown hill. First built in the 13th
          century, this fort was rebuilt by the Qutab Shahis, who made it their
          capital in 1525, and laid out its splendid monuments and parks, and a
          famous acoustic system.


          Nearby are the domed tombs of seven Qutab Shahi kings, silently
          telling you of the splendor and grandeur of an era gone by.

          Today, you have a fairly long drive, broken at Bidar, a pleasant town
          where one can visit abandoned 15th-century palaces, mosques and huge
          domed tombs, some of the finest examples of Muslim architecture in the
          Deccan.


          Bidar is still a centre of ‘Bidriware’, in which beautiful flowing
          floral and arabesque patterns are inlaid and engraved on various
          objects. This technique was developed by Persian silversmiths, whose
          descendants can be seen at work in the old part of town.

          monuments, dating from the 15th to the 17th centuries when Bijapur was
          the capital of the Adil Shahi kings. Most famous is the Golgumbaz,
          a.vast mausoleum topped with an enormous dome, the second-largest in
          the world after St Peter’s in the Vatican. The Jama Masjid and other
          examples of Muslim architecture are scattered throughout this
          traditional, fascinating town.

          The sleepy villages of Badami, Pattadakal and Aihole were once the
          capital cities of the Chalukyas, who ruled much of the Deccan between
          the 4th and 8th centuries. They built an astonishing profusion of
          temples, many still beautifully preserved. At Badami there are many
          cave temples, with rock-cut sculptures of religious figures. This is a
          fascinating, little-visited area, definitely worth the effort in
          getting here.

        content: >-
          After breakfast, drive to Hampi via Pattadakal and Aihole (160kms,
          04:00hrs).


          Once a secondary capital of the Badami Chalukyas, the tiny village of
          Pattadakal is now lost in the countryside but still famous for its
          finely carved Hindu and Jain temples, which are collectively a World
          Heritage Site. Pattadakal has a group of monuments consisting of 10
          temples on the banks of the river Malaprabha representing early
          Chalukyan architecture. The detailed descriptions in the sculptures of
          the temples give an insight into the social life of those days.


          Aihole is a small village near Badami, surrounded by small hillocks
          and scattered rock cut shrines. However, in the 5th century, Aihole
          was the capital of Chalukya Kingdome, beaming with intelligentsia.
          People travelled from far flung places to learn the science as well as
          the art of temple building in Aihole. The education of temple building
          began as early as the 5th century and continued till 12th century. A
          visit to the temples thar remain gives a glimpse on how temple
          architecture evolved over the centuries.


          Hampi was the capital of the Vijayanagar empire from 1336 to 1565. The
          city was well planned, with an efficient sewage system, a bustling
          marketplace full of luxurious goods, and countless palaces and
          temples. Today, the extensive ruins at Hampi tell a mysterious story
          about a bygone civilization. The landscape is remarkable, with miles
          and miles of granite boulders and huge rock formations standing
          against the blue skies.

        content: >-
          In the 16th century, Hampi rivalled Rome in splendour and the
          Vijayanagar empire controlled almost all of south India from here.
          After Muslim invasions, only the stone buildings and a ghost city
          remained. The ruins however are extensive, and are located amongst a
          spectacular landscape of boulders. Many of Hampi’s ruins, such as the
          Lotus Temple, the Royal Enclosure, the Elephant Stables, the Queen’s
          Bath, and the Vittala Temple, can be reached by road, but it is also
          well worth exploring on foot, or by bicycle, as this is a unique
          landscape, with a seemingly infinite number of atmospheric ruins
          scattered throughout a huge area.

          Today, you leave behind the Deccan’s plains for the lovely hills of

          eight-drive drive, getting increasingly prettier, before you reach
          Chikmagalur.


          Chikmagalur is a calm, serene town surrounded by scenic hills,
          valleys, streams and coffee plantations. Nestled in the Baba Budan
          hills, where coffee was first introduced into India, Chikmagalur is
          great for outdoor activities, and also provides a convenient base from
          which to explore the historical sites of Belur, Halebid, and
          Shravanabelagola.

        content: >-
          Today, you drive to Mysore via the old Hoysala capitals of Belur and
          Halebid, stuffed with amazing temples.


          Belur’s Chennakesava temple, still in use, is a fine example of the
          singular Hoysala style. It took 103 years to complete, with intricate
          sculptures outside and awe-inspiring filigreed pillars within. The
          Veeranarayana Temple and the smaller shrines are also worth a visit.


          The tiny hamlet of Halebid was, believe it or not, a royal capital for
          two centuries. The main attraction today is the Hoysaleshvara temple:
          this has a wealth of sculptural detail, the walls covered with gods,
          goddesses, animals and dancing girls. No two facets of the temple are
          alike. Guarded by a Nandi Bull, it was never completed, despite 86
          years of work.


          The entire drive to Mysore should take about five to six hours,
          depending on how long you spend at each stop.

          architecture, Mysore has a faded grandeur and small-town charm. The

          of sandalwood, rosewood and teak carvings, furniture, traditional
          Mysore silk, puppets and lacquer-ware and other handicrafts.

          The focal point of the city is the 19th-century Maharaja’s Palace.
          Part of it is still used by the royal family on festive occasions; the
          other part is a museum. The collection, which includes a golden howdah
          (elephant saddle) that kings used during processions, gives a taste of
          the splendid lifestyle of the Wodeyar rulers of Mysore.


          The Wodeyars were devoted to the goddess Chamundesvari, enshrined on
          Chamundi Hill (13km away). Half way up the hill is a gigantic
          monolithic Nandi Bull, about 5m high. There is also a 12th-century
          temple dedicated to the goddess.


          The afternoon is at leisure.

Kerala’s backwaters and Tamil Nadu’s temples get all the attention, but the Deccan plateau in South India has astonishing monuments and culture to offer as well. You start with Hyderabad, a royal city with a character all its own, with the huge Golconda Fort and Charminar. You carry on to the wonderful domed monuments and mosques of Gulbarga and Vijayapura, and the temples of Badami. You then find yourself in spectacular Hampi, with its ruins amid a boulder-strewn landscape, and after that in lovely, green Chikmagalur’s coffee estates, a complete contrast. Carry on via the ornately-carved temples at belur and Halebid to lovely, cosy Mysore, city of Tipu Sultan, for a relaxed end to an eye-opening trip.
