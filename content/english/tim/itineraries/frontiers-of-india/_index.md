        content: >-
          Kolkata was just a tiny village some 300 years ago. After the East
          India Company made it their first base in India, Calcutta became the
          seat of British power in India, and developed into an economic,
          industrial and political centre. At its chaotic heart is the Maidan, a
          huge green expanse with gardens, monuments and sporting facilities. At
          one end stands the Victoria Memorial, a white marble building that
          provides one of the best insights into British rule in India.

          centre of the Satra is the Naamghar - a prayer hall where monks gather

          traditional Assamese arts and crafts, and regularly stage dance dramas
          in praise of Vishnu.

          Kamalibari Monastery. If you wish, you can stay in the monastery to
          share dinner with the monks.

          Today you can visit more monasteries if you wish (the biggest one is
          nearby and has a museum and a large library), but you may also prefer
          to simply walk around the village surrounding the hotel, or cycle
          around the island. It is easy to forget that Majuli is an island,
          holding within it hills, vast open paddy fields, rivulets, dry sandy
          river beds and corpses of thick trees. Majuli falls along a major
          migratory path for ducks, geese and other birds. As a result, an
          extra-ordinary large number of birds can be seen here, even just
          simply by driving or cycling around.

        title: Half day city tour of Shillong
        content: >-
          The best way to enjoy Shillong’s sights is on foot. With no
          significant monuments, the attractions here are the scenic beauty,
          parks, waterfalls and panoramic views. Places worth visiting include
          the decorative Ward Lake, and Bara Bazaar where you can see local and
          hill-people trading their wares including interesting jewellery and
          handicrafts. Beadon Falls and Bishop Falls, north of the city, are
          popular picnic sites.

          Ri Kynjai, a spectacular resort overlooking the picturesque Umiam Lake
          outside Shillong, translates from Khasi as ‘land of serene environs’.
          The architecture is inspired by Khasi thatch huts, which make a
          symbolic presence as a cap on the roof of the cottages. No expense has
          been spared in creating this luxurious and authentic resort, making
          this the most desirable place to stay in the entire North East of
          India.

This is a fascinating tour to one of the lesser known and visited parts of India, the remote north-eastern states of Assam, Meghalaya and Nagaland. Visit tea plantations in the far east of Assam, explore tribal villages in northern Nagaland, meet the wonderful dancing monks of Majuli island, look for the rare one-horned rhinoceros in Kaziranga, and travel through the beautiful hills of Meghalaya.
