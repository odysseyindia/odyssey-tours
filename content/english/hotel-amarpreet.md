The Amarpreet Hotel offers possibly the best mid-range accommodation in Aurangabad . Although a simple hotel, it has comfortable rooms, good service and memorable food at an affordable price. This hotel draws crowds of local residents on weekends, who come to dine at the in-house restaurant, which is known for its Indian tandoori and Chinese food, and regular barbeques on the front lawn.
