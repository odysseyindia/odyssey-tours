Given that Tata Motors was the one to realise ‘sub-four-metre car' need not always mean hatchback, it has taken its own sweet time to come up with a compact SUV. Sure, the carmaker had made its intent about breaking into the segment very clear with the Nexon concept of 2014, but it’s only in September 2017 that the final product will be available at a showroom near you.
