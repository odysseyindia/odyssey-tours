Aurangabad, named after the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb, is the gateway to the World Heritage Sites of Ajanta and Ellora. These complexes of caves are superb examples of rock cut architecture. Also worth visiting are the Bibi ka Maqbara, built to rival the Taj Mahal, and the magnificent hilltop fortress of Daulatabad.
