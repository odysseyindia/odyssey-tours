Gangtok is the capital of Sikkim, a tiny but beautiful state, sandwiched between Tibet, Nepal and Bhutan. The mountainsides here are covered with orchids and vast forests of rhododendrons. Apart from the mountain scenery, the main attraction of Sikkim is its Buddhist monasteries. Sikkim is home to over 250 of these; and while some are deserted, most others like Rumtek are thriving centres of Buddhism.
