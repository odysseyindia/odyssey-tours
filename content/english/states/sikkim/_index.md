Sikkim is one of India's smallest but most beautiful states, situated in the far north-east of the subcontinent. It is considered to be still one of the last Himalayan 'Shangri-las' as a result of its remoteness, spectacular mountain terrain, hundreds of varieties of orchids, and ancient Buddhist monasteries.

Kanchenjunga, the third highest peak in the world, is an awesome presence on the western boundary. Kanchenjunga is worshipped as a god who is the presiding deity of Sikkim.

Gangtok, the capital of Sikkim, is perched high on a long ridge flanking a river and inhabited predominantly by Buddhists. Gangtok is famous for its scenic beauty and spectacular views of the Kanchenjunga. There are a number of interesting Buddhist monasteries in the vicinity of the city.

Western Sikkim is a beautiful land with virgin forests and deep river valleys. It is an ideal area for short treks and it boasts of some wonderful ancient monasteries. Pelling is a fast growing town which provides a good base for visiting the awe-inspiring ancient monastery of Pemayantse, one of the most important and revered monasteries in Sikkim.

Close to Pelling is the sacred Khechepori Lake, surrounded by lush forest cover. You can walk from here to the tiny hill town of Yuksom, a good base for treks or walks to nearby monasteries and jungles, with the mountains ever visible in the distance.

From Yuksom you can drive via the gold-topped Tashiding monastery to Ravangla, a sleepy Himalayan town overlooked by the Khanchenjunga range. Surrounded by high-forested hills and undulating valleys dotted with village huts Ravangla is an ideal place for short treks and bird watching.

## IMPORTANT

Sikkim is a restricted area but is open to foreign tourists for 15 days at a time. Foreign nationals can easily get a Sikkim entry permit endorsed on their India visa, by applying for the same to the nearest Indian mission.

Alternatively, we can arrange this for you when you get to India but in that case you require a stay in Darjeeling of a minimum of two days before going to Sikkim.
