Bodh Gaya is a sacred place for Buddhists from all over the world. It was here that Prince Siddhartha Gautama attained enlightenment beneath a bodhi tree and became the Buddha. On this sacred spot stands the majestic Mahabodhi Temple. Pilgrims from many lands have built their own temples and monasteries, offering meditation courses varying from a week to a month. The International Meditation Centre also holds courses.
