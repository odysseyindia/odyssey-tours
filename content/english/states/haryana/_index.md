Haryana is bordered by Punjab and Himachal Pradesh to the north, and by Rajasthan to the west and south. The eastern border to Uttaranchal and Uttar Pradesh is defined by the Yamuna river.     Haryana also surrounds Delhi on three sides, forming the northern, western and southern borders of Delhi. Consequently, a large part of Haryana is included in the National Capital Region.
