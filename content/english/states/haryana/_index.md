Haryana is bordered by Punjab and Himachal Pradesh to the north, and by Rajasthan to the west and south. The eastern border to Uttaranchal and Uttar Pradesh is defined by the Yamuna river.

Haryana also surrounds Delhi on three sides, forming the northern, western and southern borders of Delhi. Consequently, a large part of Haryana is included in the National Capital Region.
 

Haryana has the 3rd highest per capita income in the country. It is one of India's most industrialized states, and is considered to be the current growth engine of India, with the city of Gurgaon rapidly emerging as a major hub for the information technology and automobile industries.

Gurgaon is considered a new satellite town of Delhi, situated just south of the city and close to Delhi's International and Domestic Airports. The city has grown extensively during the last decade and has become one of the most prominent outsourcing and off shoring hubs in South Asia.

The outsourcing boom has led to a demographic shift to a younger, more cosmopolitan, more affluent and well-educated population. This in turn has stimulated a mushrooming of shopping malls, up-market restaurants and entertainment facilities.

The capital of the state is Chandigarh which is administered as a union territory and is also the capital of Punjab.
