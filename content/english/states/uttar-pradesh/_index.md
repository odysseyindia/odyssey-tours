The northern state of Uttar Pradesh, popularly know as UP, is India's most populous state. It is the heartland of Hindi, the principal indigenous language of India, and the official language of government.    The plains of Uttar Pradesh have always been a fertile land, nourished by the Ganges and its tributaries. Here you find the famous Taj Mahal and other great monuments of the Moghul era in India, as well as the holy Hindu city of Varanasi and the Buddhist stupas of Sarnath.
