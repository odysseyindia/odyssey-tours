The Taj Mahal is one of the most fascinating and beautiful monuments in the world. About 20,000 workers were employed in its construction, which took some 20 years. Agra's Red Fort, built in the form of a half moon on the Yamuna river, is a masterpiece of design. The fort's colossal walls are encircled by a moat and contain a maze of buildings, that form a small city within a city. You visit both on a half-day guided tour.
