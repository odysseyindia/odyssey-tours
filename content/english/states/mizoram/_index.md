Mizoram cannot boast of five star facilities nor of any exceptional amenities and tourist services. Except for visitors from various Christian organizations, persons on official visits and the odd research scholar, few tourists visit Mizoram.

This is sure to change in the future as Mizoram is a very attractive state with a friendly a very hospitable population, a wide array of festivals and dances, handicrafts, flora and fauna, breathtaking natural beauty and temperate climate.

Mizoram is hilly region with at least 80% of the area under lush green forest and bamboo groves. The state is home to eight Wildlife Sanctuaries and two National Parks.

The Mizos are well known for their handloom and bamboo handicrafts which are still carried out in the traditional way. Mizo women are known to weave traditional textiles from the comfort of their homes, and sell them at the Bara bazaar in Aizawl. Mizo men are on the other hand expert craftsmen, working on cane and bamboo.

Aizawl is the state's largest city, but still very remote. It is a lively place with quaint timber houses and interesting-looking churches. Each house has its own window box of profusely blooming orchids. The streets echo with melodies emanating from the guitars of Aizawl youth playing at nearly every street corner.

Oral tradition reveals (there is no known recorded history) that the Mizos migrated from their homeland in China about 3 centuries ago, in search of new pastures and settled in these remote Mizo Hills (Lushai Hills). The Mizos were animists, believing in good and evil spirits of the woodland.

From the 19th Century, the Christian Missionaries have played a dominating role in the State, 85.73% of the population are Christians and are greatly responsible for the westernization of its social life. English is one of the commonly spoken languages.

The Mizo have an egalitarian society having no class or distinction based on caste, religion or gender. Today, Mizoram enjoys 87 percent literacy (second highest in India- a fact in which every Mizo takes genuine pride).

There has also been a concerted effort though by the young to propagate their ancient cultural strains by clinging to their traditional roots resulting in bringing to the limelight some of the most vibrant ancient Mizo traditions, cultural heritage and colourful customs.

The spring festival of Chapchar Kut is the most important in Mizoram. The festival occurs in March and men and women of all ages dressed in traditional and colourful costumes, exotic headgears and jewellery, to assemble and perform various folk dances. They also sing traditional songs accompanied by beating of drums, gongs and cymbals.

## IMPORTANT

In a move widely welcomed, the policy which requires special permits for travel in some areas of North East India has been dissolved as of 1 January, 2011. Now, only a valid visa is necessary for tourists visiting Manipur, Mizoram and Nagaland. However, travel to Arunachal Pradesh will still

require special permission.

Foreigners no longer require a Protected Area Permit (PAP). However they must register themselves at the local Foreigners Registration Office (FRO) of the districts they visit within 24 hours of arrival.
