Aizawl (pronounced Eye-jull), the isolated capital of Mizoram, is built along a central ridge and several surrounding spurs. White-painted churches stand out above residential buildings that cling precariously to the hillsides. Built on steep slopes, Aizawl could well be the world's steepest capital. Houses often have front doors at street level while the backs stand precariously on stilts three times higher than their roofs.
