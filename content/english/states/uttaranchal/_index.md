In the year 2000 the northern state of Uttaranchal was carved out of the hill areas of Uttar Pradesh. It is a small state filled to the brim with religious sites, wildlife reserves and cool hills that invite escape.     You can visit temples, ashrams and yoga centres at the holy cities of Haridwar and Rishikesh, float on a rubber raft along the Ganges, go on wildlife safaris in Corbett National Park, and follow trekking trails or relax in picturesque hill stations like Nainital and Ramgarh or Dehra Dun and Mussoorie.
