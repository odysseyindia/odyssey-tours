Founded in the early 12th century, the religious enclave of Alchi houses an extraordinary wealth of ancient wall paintings and wood sculpture inside five tiny mud-walled temples. It is considered the jewel among Ladakh's monasteries, one of the few that escaped the Muslim depredations of the 14th century.
