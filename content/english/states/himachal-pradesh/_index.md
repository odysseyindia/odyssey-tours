Himachal Pradesh is India's most popular and easily accessible hill state. The snowy mountains and steep hillsides have ensured that the region has remained an idyllic place, little touched by the fast changing world around it.     Visit Himachal Pradesh for its spectacular vistas of snowy mountains, its Raj-era picturesque hill stations, its dignified Tibetan Buddhist temples and its wonderfully warm people.
