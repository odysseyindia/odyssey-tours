Built in 1884, the Oberoi Cecil is a heritage hotel, and Shimla's finest. Glossy Burma teak floors, strewn with Persian rugs, along with crackling wood-fires create a rich and warm atmosphere. Much of the furniture is original classic and the furnishings are sumptuous. The Cecil features plush rooms, a number of eateries, a heated pool and an international-standard spa and sauna.
