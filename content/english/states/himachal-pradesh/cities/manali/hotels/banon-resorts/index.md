A handsome stone building with picturesque dormer windows, Banon Resorts spreads over 2 acres of land close to the busy town centre of Manali.     The hotel is named after the owner's forefather an Irish Captain Banon who is said to have planted the first apple orchard here.     An upmarket hotel, it features large  rooms, many of which have balconies from which one can admire the hilly surroundings of Manali.   There are lawns on all sides dotted with flowers, a hip indoor pub and an outdoor restaurant.
