The Union Territory of Pondicherry comprises four coastal regions: Pondicherry and Karaikal, situated on the east coast of Tamil Nadu, Yanam in Andra Pradesh and Mahe on the west coast of Kerala. Pondicherry is the capital of this Union Territory.

Pondicherry has a unique ambience, unlike any place else in India. It is a blend of spiritual aura, French colonial heritage, Tamil culture, and the cosmopolitan flair of hosting many nationalities in a small but varied town.
 
The state of Pondicherry was a French colony for some 200 years and retains much evidence of this today. The Pondicherry Museum is a treasure trove of antiques with a section on French India which is housed in rooms decorated in typical French style.

More recently Pondicherry achieved fame as the home of the Sri Aurobindo Ashram, now largely a museum dedicated to the life of its founder, invariably known simply as "The Mother" who died in 1973. Her unique experiment in international living, the community of Auroville, continues to prosper nearby.
