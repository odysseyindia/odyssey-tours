This deluxe tented camp only operates during the one-week Pushkar Fair period. The camp, a little distance away from the fair ground, consists of spacious and carpeted Swiss Cottage tents with comfortable beds, good quality linen and Rajasthani hand-block printed quilts. The camp has specially-designed modern toilets with running hot and cold water. Your stay is on full-board basis.
