The former town house of the rulers of Mandawa has been converted into a heritage hotel and so has a really characterful feel. Situated on Sansar Chandra Road, in close proximity to the old city, the haveli is tucked away amidst tranquil gardens. It has 27 comfortable rooms with attached baths. All rooms in the rambling building have been furnished in the traditional style. There are nice little seating areas outside to relax and read.
