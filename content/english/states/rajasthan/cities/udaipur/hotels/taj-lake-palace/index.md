The most romantic palace in the world. Set on an island in Lake Pichola, the dazzling white building can only be reached by boat from a jetty below the City Palace. The interiors are delightful, with a lotus pond-filled courtyard, flaming bougainvillea, and constant glimpses of the lake and the magnificent City Palace. An absolutely spectacular hotel, the Lake Palace Hotel is truly one of the world's most special hotels.
