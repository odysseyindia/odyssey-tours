A delightful 17th-century haveli, right on the banks of Lake Pichola. The whitewashed walls and plants create an atmosphere of pure relaxation and tranquility in this otherwise busy area. The rooms differ in size and decor, but are all attractive, with local fabrics and antique furniture. Most do not have lake views, but the many terraces, the rooftop pool and the restaurant all have excellent views of Lake Pichola.
