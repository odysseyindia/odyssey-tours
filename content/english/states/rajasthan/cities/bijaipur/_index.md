Bijaipur is a quaint village, 40km from the famous hilltop fort at Chittaurgarh. It is home to the 200-year-old Castle Bijaipur, now converted into a heritage hotel. Use this destination to recharge your batteries by relaxing at the outdoor pool, or rent a bicycle to explore the region. The country roads are fairly empty apart from farm vehicles and many shepherds with their cattle or flocks of sheep.
