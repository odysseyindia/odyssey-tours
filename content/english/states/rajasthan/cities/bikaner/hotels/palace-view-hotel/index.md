This is your perfect chance to live with a Rajput family. This delightful Hotel Palace View is run by the very hospitable and charming owners, Vikramsingh, a Rajput aristocrat, and his wife.     Their bungalow is set in a small garden right in the Lallgarh Palace complex and offers `home stay' in good-sized, spotlessly clean rooms. Delicious meals are served in the personal dining room.
