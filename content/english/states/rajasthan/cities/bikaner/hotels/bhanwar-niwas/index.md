A lovely pink sandstone haveli in the narrow winding streets of old Bikaner. Built in the early 20th century, the building is a fascinating combination of Indian and European styles with just a few large, richly furnished rooms, giving it a hushed, private feel. There are grand ceilings, stencils and friezes; the Blue Drawing room is in pale blue and gold leaf, the Grand Staircase in a riot of gold - you will be dazzled!
