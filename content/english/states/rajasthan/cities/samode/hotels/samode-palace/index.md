A fairytale palace nestled picturesquely amid rugged hills, this superb 18th-century palace has public areas of immense beauty such as the Sultan Mahal, the Sheesh Mahal and, grandest of all, the Durbar Hall, with the finest of Shekhavati-style frescoes. The rooms have old-world charm replete with antique furniture, and fabulous modern bathrooms. There are two delightful swimming pools, and several atmospheric dining areas.
