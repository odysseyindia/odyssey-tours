Dholpur lies at the eastern edge of Rajasthan on the border with Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. It is fortuitously located between Agra and Gwalior, less than an hour's drive in either direction. A unique feature of Dholpur is its closeness to the Chambal ravines of Madhya Pradesh, once famous for their bandits - and now for great birding and crocodile-spotting. You can explore the area by boat and by jeep.
