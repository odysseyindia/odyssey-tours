This small, charming mansion, built around a courtyard, was constructed in the Indo-Saracenic tradition in the 1920s. Ishwari Niwas has been with members of the royal family except for the period when it was a royal guest house. In a sense, that is what it is now, with rooms which are furnished with local furniture and fabrics. It a peaceful place.
