A charming, small palace, set in 50 acres of orchard, and owned by the Masuda Royal Family. The rooms carry their royal ambience by their original vintage furniture and exotic scenario of traditional Rajasthani wall murals and frescoes. It is an ideal royal getaway where you can relax in the gardens or by the pool.
