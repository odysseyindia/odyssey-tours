A traditional Rajput feudal homestead, this rambling structure has well-appointed rooms around a courtyard with a shimmering swimming pool. Off the main courtyard is the small but lavishly-decorated dining hall, where meals are served in buffet style. There is also a separate formal lounge with comfortable sofas. The garden area has small shrubs and trees and inviting benches for relaxation.
