The design of Devi Garh's interiors is completely contemporary, almost austere. You will not see the typical riot of colours associated with Rajasthan. The dominant colour here is white - of marble, of white on white plaster motifs on walls. Highly luxurious, the hotel offers rooms that are all different from each other, spectacular views from the many lounges, and a great spa.
