A lovely resort situated in the heart of Kerala's backwaters. This is a beautiful area of coconut forests, green paddies, thatched villages and lotus-filled lagoons.     There are individual cottages along the banks of the canal with sit-outs to enjoy the views. The restaurant serves Kerala cuisine, served on the traditional plantain leaves.     You can explore the surrounding areas on foot, by bicycle or in a dug-out canoe.
