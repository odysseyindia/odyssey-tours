A wonderful old heritage home on Kerala's backwaters with a very friendly host who believes passionately in preserving his family's traditions. Time can be spent watching the toddy tappers climbing the tall trees, walking among the paddy fields or along the river banks, or rowing through the narrow canals in a country boat.
