A peaceful retreat surrounded by fruit trees and spice gardens with a gurgling stream running through it. The cottages are simple but well furnished in colours that blend with the environment. A great deal of attention has been lavished on the large, immaculately-designed bathrooms. There is a lovely swimming pool and Ayurvedic massage and yoga centre, and even a library with a fireplace.
