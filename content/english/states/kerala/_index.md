Kerala is a narrow, fertile strip of land wedged between the verdant hills and rain forests of the Western Ghats and the wide beaches of the Arabian Sea. In between is a labyrinth of backwaters lined with coconut palms and lush paddy fields.     The infinite shades of tropical green that one can see in Kerala, is the reason that Kerala has come to be known as `God's own country.'
