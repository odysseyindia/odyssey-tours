During the 18th century, Murshidabad became the capital of Bengal and the richest and most glamourous city of India, famous for silk, woven saris and muslin. The wealthiest merchants from across India migrated to Murshidabad, later followed by British, French, Dutch and Danish trading companies. Having contributed 5 percent of the entire global economy in the late 18th and early 19th  century, Murshidabad fell out of favour during British colonial rule, and is nowadays a slightly forgotten and hidden corner of India.
