West Bengal is unique among Indian states as it stretches from the sea to the mountains.     To the south, the capital Kolkata dominates the political, economic and cultural life of much of eastern India.     The northern foothills of West Bengal's Himalaya are one of the greatest tea growing areas in the world. Here you find Raj-era hill stations such as the picturesque towns of Darjeeling and Kalimpong.
