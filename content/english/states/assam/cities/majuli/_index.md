Majuli is the largest river island in the world. The island, a World Heritage Site in the Brahmaputra river, is known for its beautiful rural setting, dancing monks and traditional tribal architecture. A visit to Majuli allows you to gently contemplate mesmerising landscapes of rice fields, water meadows and fish traps, meet the local Mishing people and learn about Neo-Vaishnavite philosophy at one of Majuli's ancient satras.
