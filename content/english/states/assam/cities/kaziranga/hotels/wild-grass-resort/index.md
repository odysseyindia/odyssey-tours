The oldest jungle lodge in Kaziranga, Wild Grass is located in a picturesque village close to the main entrance to the park. The rooms, in 2 tall blocks, have plenty of charm, with cane chairs and wooden furniture. There is a large dining room, with an inviting terrace overlooking the gardens. Wild Grass has its own dedicated team of knowledgeable naturalists, who accompany all excursions into the National Park.
