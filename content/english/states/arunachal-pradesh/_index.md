Arunachal Pradesh border three countries: Bhutan, Myanmar and China, with Assam to its south and Nagaland to the southeast. Though Arunachal Pradesh is an Indian State, China claims portions as South Tibet.    Arunachal Pradesh has only recently been opened doors to visitors, leaving much of its lands largely unexplored, and untouched. With over a hundred tribes, thirty languages, and a treasure trove of flora and fauna, this is indeed the last frontier.
