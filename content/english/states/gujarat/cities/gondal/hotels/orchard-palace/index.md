A lovely palace with just seven guest rooms, set in a huge complex of fruit orchards, lawns and gardens. A delightful accommodation option is the beautifully restored Rail Saloon of the royal family! The "room of miniatures" is a splendid sitting room with a collection of miniature paintings, brass and antique furniture. The vast property also includes an impressive collection of classic and vintage cars.
