Goa, Daman and Diu were Portuguese possessions in India which were liberated in 1961. Whilst Goa became a State, a Union Territory was formed in 1987 consisting of the two separate districts of Daman and Diu.

Diu was a seaport and naval base of considerable strategic importance from the 14th to 16th centuries. It was also a vital trade link with the rest of India for overseas traders.



The island of Diu though geographically a part of Gujarat, is an independent entity.

Like Goa and Daman, Diu was originally a Portuguese colony until its accession to India in 1961. However, to this day, it retains a very distinctive atmosphere.

The town is a maze of narrow, winding streets and many of the houses are well ornamented and brightly painted. There are a number of interesting churches and a huge 16th century fort built in a Christian Portuguese style. Nearby is a beautiful sandy beach at Ahmedpur Mandvi.

Diu is a favourite holiday destination for people from the neighbouring dry state of Gujarat - alcohol is available here!
