Goa, Daman and Diu were Portuguese possessions in India which were liberated in 1961. Whilst Goa became a State, a Union Territory was formed in 1987 consisting of the two separate districts of Daman and Diu.     Diu was a seaport and naval base of considerable strategic importance from the 14th to 16th centuries. It was also a vital trade link with the rest of India for overseas traders.
