Manipur, located on the far north east border below Nagaland, has been described it as the Jewel of the East owing to its picturesque hills and valleys. Imphal, the capital, is surrounded by wooded hills and lakes.

Manipur is also home to the Loktak Lake, the largest fresh water lake in the north-east region. Much of it falls within the Keibuk Lamjao National Park. This park has a small population of 'dancing deer', the endangered brow-antlered deer.
 
Nesting in the hills of the north east of India, Manipur is bordered by Nagaland in the north, Mizoram in the south and Assam in the west. In the east it shares an international border with Burma (Myanmar).

The capital Imphal (from yumpham, homestead) lies in the heart of an oval shaped valley cut through by narrow rivers and surrounded by forested hills. The city has a large open space for the polo ground, a sport Manipuris claim to have invented.

Manipur has always been quite independent of its neighbouring tribal areas. However, the rulers of Manipur had to indulge in constant warfare with Burma. In 1826, the British took control of Manipur after signing the Treaty of Yandaboo with the Burmese.

In 1939 a remarkable women's social revolt led to government action against monopolistic traders. The role of women traders can be seen most colourfully in Imphal's women's market.

During the Second World War most of Manipur was occupied by the Japanese, with 250,000 British and Indian troops trapped under siege in Imphal for three months. After India's independence, Manipur was first made a Union Territory and subsequently achieved statehood in 1972.

The majority of the population belongs to the Meithe tribe who lives in the valleys and is related to the Shans of Burma. The tribe has created in isolation, their own fascinating version of Vaishnavite Hinduism. The 20 or so hill-tribes who constitute about a third of the population are Christian.

Manipur has recently begun taking steps to develop its tourist potential, which is essential as the state struggles to overcome poverty in rural areas and rebellions between ethnic groups, particularly between Kukis and Nagas.

## IMPORTANT

In a move widely welcomed, the policy which requires special permits for travel in some areas of North East India has been dissolved as of 1 January, 2011. Now, only a valid visa is necessary for tourists visiting Manipur, Mizoram and Nagaland. However, travel to Arunachal Pradesh will still

require special permission.

Foreigners no longer require a Protected Area Permit (PAP). However they must register themselves at the local Foreigners Registration Office (FRO) of the districts they visit within 24 hours of arrival.
