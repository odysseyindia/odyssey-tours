Situated on the north-western border of India, in Punjab, the 400-year-old city of the Golden Temple is the paramount seat of Sikh history and culture. More recently, it has also become known for the unique border-closing ceremony that takes place every evening at nearby Wagah, at the only open land border between India and Pakistan.
