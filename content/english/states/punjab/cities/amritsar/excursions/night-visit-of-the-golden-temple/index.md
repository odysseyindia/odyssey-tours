It is well worth visiting this spectacular monument in the evening. The golden light from the main temple is brilliantly reflected in the surrounding pool of water, and pilgrims and locals relax here, enjoying the cooling breeze after the oppressive heat of the day. Around 22:30 there is a short closing ceremony, when the Sikh holy book is taken from the main shrine for a few hours.
