Coral hideaway in the Arabian Sea

Deep in the azure waters of the Indian Ocean lies the last of the enchanted isles. The Lakshadweep, or Laccadive Islands, is a string of little known islands lying approximately 200 miles off the coast of Kerala.

The jewel of the Lakshadweep is Bangaram Island. A teardrop shaped, uninhabited island where there are no intrusions from the everyday world. No televisions, no telephone or newspapers. This is the perfect place to relax or to discover the myriad forms of undersea life by snorkeling or scuba diving.
 

The Lakshadweep Administration has stopped issuing entry permit to visit the Lakshadweep Islands from 01 November 2011 onwards.

Bangaram Island Resort is no more operational due to a legal tussle with the Lakshadweep Administration over the ownership of the resort, and the case is currently in the Supreme Court of India.

As a result, travel to the Lakshadweep Islands is NOT possible for tourists at the moment.

The only other option for Scuba diving holidays / Island Vacations is the Andaman Islands.
