Port Blair is the capital of the Andaman & Nicobar Islands. This string of more than 300 almost virgin islands lies quietly in the Andaman Sea, east of the Bay of Bengal, hardly touched by modern civilization.

Recently, this idyllic tropical paradise has opened up to foreign visitors, offering exotic and relaxing holiday destinations on its beautiful palm fringed beaches and turquoise blue waters.

The islands are ringed with fine white coral sand and one only has to wade in knee-deep to enter an underwater world filled with myriad dazzling fish and corals. The best place to holiday is Havelock Island.

The Andamans also provide clear and shallow waters, perfect for scuba diving and snorkeling enthusiasts to explore!
