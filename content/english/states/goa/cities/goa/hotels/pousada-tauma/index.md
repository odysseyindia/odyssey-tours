An exquisite, tropical hideaway set in superb tropical gardens, Pausada Tauma is built in laterite stone around a lovely natural swimming pool.     The hotel has 12 comfortable villas, each with its own garden, lush with tropical plants. The rooms are decorated in earthy colours so as to blend in with the surroundings.     Pousada's restaurant, the Copper Bowl, serves great coastal food with an emphasis on sea food.
