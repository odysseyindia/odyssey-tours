Goa is so beautiful that it is not surprising that the Portuguese stayed on for 450 years! They endowed the predominantly Hindu land with a Latin language and flavour that is still very alive and thriving, decades after the Portuguese heyday.     One can drive through peaceful towns with their Portuguese style bungalows, stop at a small taverna for a drink of feni, or bask for hours on the pristine beaches.
