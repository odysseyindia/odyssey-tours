Goa is so beautiful that it is not surprising that the Portuguese stayed on for 450 years! They endowed the predominantly Hindu land with a Latin language and flavour that is still very alive and thriving, decades after the Portuguese heyday.

One can drive through peaceful towns with their Portuguese style bungalows, stop at a small taverna for a drink of feni, or bask for hours on the pristine beaches.

The former Portuguese colony of Goa boasts a coastline with some of the world's most beautiful beaches, palm fringed rivers moving lazily down to the Arabian Sea, lush scenery with paddy fields, mango groves, white washed villas and easy-going, warm and hospitable people.

Panjim, the capital of Goa, is the smallest and most pleasant of state capitals. The old town has still preserved its Portuguese heritage remarkably well with several traditional Goan houses still featuring the overhanging balconies and red-tiled roofs, white-washed churches and numerous small cafes and bars.

In Old Goa, the churches of the St Cathedral, Basilica of Bom Jesus and the St Francis Church are outstanding monuments to the legacy left behind by the Portuguese.

These days, Goa's easy-going ambience, good food, and lovely climate have made it one of the most popular beach destinations in India to unwind.
