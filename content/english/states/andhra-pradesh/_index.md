Andhra Pradesh is a state in southern India. It borders the Bay of Bengal in the east and shares boundaries with Telangana in the north-west, Chhattisgarh in the north, Odisha (formerly known as Orissa) in the north-east, Tamil Nadu in the south and Karnataka in the west.     Andhra Pradesh has a rich cultural heritage, seen in the ancient Buddhist centre of Nagarjunakonda, and the hilltop temple at Tirupati, which attracts more pilgrims than any other temple in India.    Andhra Pradesh also offers travellers some sprawling beaches and breathtaking hills and caves.
