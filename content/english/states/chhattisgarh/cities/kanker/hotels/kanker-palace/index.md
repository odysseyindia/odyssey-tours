A palace which recalls memories of a bygone era. Its castle-like facade, spacious rooms, high ceiling, dainty windows and ventilators, quaint draw-fans and an outhouse will transport you to a different time. You could spend some time with the Royal family, sharing their understanding of the region, its culture and history. Your stay is on full board basis and includes local excursions.
