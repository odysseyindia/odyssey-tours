Goa, Daman and Diu were Portuguese possessions in India which were liberated in 1961. Whilst Goa became a State, a Union Territory was formed in 1987 consisting of the two separate districts of Daman and Diu.     Daman is a tiny enclave, tucked away in the southern tip of Gujarat, adjoining Maharashtra. A few people still use Portuguese in everyday speech.
