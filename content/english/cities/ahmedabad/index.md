Ahmedabad is the cultural capital of Gujarat and a major textile and crafts center of India. The city is also packed with a diversity of architectural styles, with over fifty mosques and tombs, as well as Hindu and Jain temples and grand step-wells which often display beautiful carvings. The old part of town has a maze of narrow winding alleys with carved wooden house fronts and thriving bazaars.
