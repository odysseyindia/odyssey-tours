The drive from Bumthang to Mongar takes you through one of the most spectacular roads carved into vertical cliffs, spectacular waterfalls and lush vegetation. Mongar (1,600m) is the second largest town in the east of Bhutan.    A visit to the Mongar Dzong shows one how traditional Bhutanese architecture has continued to thrive. Although built in the 1930s, the Mongar Dzong is constructed in the same way as all earlier dzongs, without plans or nails.
