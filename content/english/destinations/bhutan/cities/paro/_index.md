The broad and beautiful Paro valley is the entry point for all visitors flying into Bhutan on the national carrier, Druk Air. The Paro valley is one of the kingdom's most fertile, producing the bulk of Bhutan's famous red rice from its terraced fields.    Paro (2200m) is home to many of Bhutan's oldest temples and monasteries. The highlights are the Paro Dzong, a fortress-monastery, and the nearby Tiger's Nest, the place where Bhutan's history begins.
