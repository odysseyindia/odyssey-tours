Thimpu (2320m) became the capital in 1961 and the town is the largest in Bhutan. It is about 1.5 hour from the airport in Paro. Even though Thimpu has changed much over the years there are still no traffic lights!     Places to visit in Thimphu include the Textile Museum, the Folk Heritage Museum, the Trashichho Dzong, the National Memorial Chorten, and the Centenary Farmer's Market - a colorful market full of local produce and handicrafts.
