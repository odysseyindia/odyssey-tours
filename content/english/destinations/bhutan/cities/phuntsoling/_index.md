Phuntsoling is the Gateway to Bhutan when you travel overland from India. It is a full day's scenic drive through carpets of tea estates from either Bagdogra airport, New Jalpaiguri railway station, Darjeeling or Kalimpong.     You then cross over the border on foot, complete the necessary passport formalities and then walk into your hotel in Phuntsoling.Phuntsholing is a fascinating mixture of India and Bhutan, a perfect example of mingling of people and their cultures.
