A few hours' drive from Wangdue Phodrang is the Phobjika valley (2,900m). Here also is Gangtey Gompa, a monastery dating back to the 17th century. This monastery is dramatically situated at the head of the valley and is inhabited only in summer months.    Spotting black-necked cranes in the meadows of the valley floor is an ornithologist's dream come true. These rare birds migrate from the high plains of the Tibetan plateau in winter to the milder climate of Phobjika.
