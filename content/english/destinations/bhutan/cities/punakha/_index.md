Punakha (1,220m) is the ancient capital of Bhutan. It takes approximately 2 1/4 hours drive from Thimphu across Dochu-la pass (3116m). This pass offers splendid panoramic views of the Himalayan mountain ranges.     Once you cross the pass, you wind down into a sub-tropical valley where food grains, vegetables and fruits grow in abundance. The main attraction is the Punakha Dzong, a stunning example of Bhutanese architecture.
