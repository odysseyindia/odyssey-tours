The road from Trashigang to Samdrup Jongkhar (280m), completed in the 1960s, enables the eastern half of the country to access and benefit from trade with the south as well as across the Indian border.     There is little to see in this area other than the busy market which straddles the border. From Sampdruk Jongkhar it is a short drive to Guwahati, the capital of Assam, from where there are onward flight and train connections.
