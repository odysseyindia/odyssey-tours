The road from Wangdue to Trongsa (2,000m) is one of the prettiest in Bhutan passing streams, forests and villages before climbing the Pelele Pass on the Black Mountain ranges in to the Trongsa Velley.    The landscape around Trongsa is spectacular and its impressive Dzong, stretched along a ridge above a ravine, first comes into view about an hour before the winding, mountain road leads you into the town itself.
