Trashigang (1,100m) lies in the far east of Bhutan, and is the countries largest district. Once the centre for a busy trade with Tibet, today Trashigang is the junction of the east-west highway, with road connections to Samdrup Jongkhar.    Trashigang is a melting pot of hill tribe people who come to the town to trade. The Trashigang Dzong towers above the town and is the first landmark that can be seen from the road winding up to Trashigang.
