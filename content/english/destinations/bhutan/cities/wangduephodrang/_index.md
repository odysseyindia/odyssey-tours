Sitting on top of a hill, the formidable Wangduephodrang Dzong is the town's most visible feature. In the 17th century it played a critical role in unifying western, central and southern Bhutan.     The town itself (1,300m) is little more than an enlarged village with well-provided shops and hotels. The higher reaches of the Wangduephodrang, the Probjikha valley, is the winter home to the endangered black neck cranes.
