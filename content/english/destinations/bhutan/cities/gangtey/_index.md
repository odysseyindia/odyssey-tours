East of Punakha, the road passes through the colourful village of Wangdue Phodrang and climbs past deep ravines with dizzying drops to the little visited, picturesque valley of Phobjikha, home to the quaint rural settlement of Gangtey.     Phobjikha is a wide, beautiful alpine wetland valley where the Black Necked Cranes fly down from Tibet to spend the winter. These majestic birds are some of only 5000 left in the world today.
