On the far side of the Black Mountains you will enter a part of the country that until the 1970s was only accessible by mule and foot trails. Jakar (2,700m) is the main town in a collection of 4 valleys known collectively as Bumthang.     Apart from its spectacular natural beauty, Bumthang is noted for its many temple complexes and palaces. You need a three-night stay to enjoy all the valleys have to offer. It is one of the best places to get out on foot, with walks to suit everyone.
