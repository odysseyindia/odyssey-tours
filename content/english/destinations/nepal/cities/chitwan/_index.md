Nepal conjures up images of snowy mountains, but it also has the terai, a grassy region of lower-lying plains. In the middle of these is the lovely Chitwan National Park, a great place to look for the endangered one-horned rhino, tigers, birds and plenty of other wildlife in varying landscapes. Its waterways even contain the rare Gangetic dolphin, so this is a fabulous spot for anyone who enjoys being out in the wild.
