Probably the best-known luxury wildlife lodge in Chitwan national park. Nestled beside lush forest and overlooking idyllic Terai landscapes, the lodge is inspired by the longhouse style of Tharu architecture and built from local materials. Offering rooms and tents, it's an intimate wildlife lodge. Dine al fresco under a mango tree, take a refreshing dip in the pool, or simply sway gently in a hammock in the afternoon breeze.
