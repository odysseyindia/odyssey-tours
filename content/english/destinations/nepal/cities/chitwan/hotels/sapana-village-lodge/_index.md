A unique hotel at Chitwan national park, which, amazingly, has its own (rehabilitated) elephants! An eco-lodge attached to a social-service NGO, it employs people from the local Tharu tribe, grows its own vegetables, and uses solar power. The rooms are simple but cheerful and brightly coloured, and there is a lovely open-air terrace and a flower garden, from where you can watch the resident elephants. A fun choice in Chitwan.
