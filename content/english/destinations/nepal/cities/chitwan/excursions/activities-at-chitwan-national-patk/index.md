A full day for jungle walks, river safaris and jeep safaris. Go in search of the majestic Royal Bengal tiger and watch the Greater one-horned rhinoceros roam free, while the great Asiatic elephants move about the jungles in herds. Along the marshes and rivers you will find gharial and marsh mugger crocodiles basking in the sun.
