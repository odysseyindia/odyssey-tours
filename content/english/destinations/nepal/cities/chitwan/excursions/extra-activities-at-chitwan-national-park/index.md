Another full day of activities in Chitwan. Your days can be tailored to your interests. If you're keen on birdwatching you might enjoy a river safari to see some of the migrating bird species. You can also spend some quality time visiting the elephant and gharial breeding centers, a perfect way to educate your kids about these animals and their life cycle, or observe local tribal life by visiting a Tharu village.
