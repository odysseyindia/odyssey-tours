Namche Bazaar is tucked away between two ridges amongst the giant peaks of the Khumbu. An ancient marketplace where goods from as far away as Tibet were and still are traded, Namche today boasts an abundance of lodges, cafes, bars and souvenir shops.

 

The location of our lodge is superb giving us a bird's-eye view over Namche and across the Valley to the serrated ridges of the Kongde range, while the magnificent peak of Thamserku (6,623m) rises as a backdrop. Just a short walk away is a classic view of Ama Dablam, one of the most beautiful mountains in all Nepal and of Lhotse and Everest. This is an ideal place to spend the day, acclimatising to the new altitude before heading further up-valley to Thame.

 

If you wish to explore, close to our lodge is the internationally known Museum of Sherpa Culture, and the traditional villages of Kunde and Kumjung are a highly recommended half-day excursion.
