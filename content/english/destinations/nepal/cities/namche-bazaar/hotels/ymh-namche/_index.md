YMH Namche Lodge, perched on the upper slopes of the bustling Sherpa capital, is breathtaking â€“ literally! The views at this lodge, at 3,340m, are outstanding. Guests can enjoy the cosy rooms with their Khumbu-inspired decor and wooden touches, and the dining room with its warming, sealed chimney.
