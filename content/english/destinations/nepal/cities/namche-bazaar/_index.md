Namche Bazaar (3,500 m) is situated on the slope of an arch-shaped mountain, with amazing views of giant Himalayan peaks from anywhere in the valley. Once a major trading center of the Khumbu region, Sherpas from neighboring villages and traders from Tibet would gather to barter goods displaying exotic traditional arts and crafts. Despite its prosperity, Namche Bazaar still retains its ancient culture, traditions and hospitality.
