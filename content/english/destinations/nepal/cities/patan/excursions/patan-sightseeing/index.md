Like Bhaktapur, Patan was once an independent kingdom that rivaled Kathmandu. This importance is still evident in its fine Durbar Square, a collection of palace buildings and temples like the Hiranya Varna Mahabihar or Golden Temple - which is actually a monastery! In one wing of the palace is the excellent Patan Museum, which showcases the religious arts and architecture of the Kathmandu Valley.    Patan is also a great city for walking around and exploring on your own. Staying around the Durbar Square lets you look around all the monuments at your own pace, as well as giving you a glimpse of Newari traditions. Patan is also a great place to hunt for souvenirs: you'll find lots of traditional craftsmen selling Buddhist thangka paintings, metal statues, jewellery and brass and copper cookware.
