An old, traditional brick and timber Newari house transformed into a beautiful heritage hotel, right in Patan's Durbar Square. All the rooms in this boutique hotel are individually styled, and there is a private courtyard in the traditional configuration. There is a restaurant among the arches, and even an in-house brewery! A great place to immerse yourself in the artistic traditions of Patan.
