Beyond the suburbs of Kathmandu lies Patan, known for its lovely Durbar Square and its traditions of art and architecture. Built in 250AD, this is one of the three royal cities in the Kathmandu Valley. You can explore the temples and palaces of Durbar Square, and visit monuments like Royal Baths, Mahaboudha, Krishna Mandir and more. Patan also houses a Tibetan refugee camp, well worth a visit.
