You have a day to either relax and acclimatise or take a short trek nearby. A steady pace is required for the steep trail up to Thame Monastery. Most people agree that viewing the interior of the traditionally decorated gompa is well worth the effort of the climb.

 

After spending some time here, there is the option to extend our acclimatisation walk up to a shoulder of Sumdur Peak, where we have magnificent views of Teng Kangpoche, Kongde and Everest.
