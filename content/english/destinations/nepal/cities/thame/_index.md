Thame (3,750m) is a very traditional and pretty village, and as it is not on the main Lukla to Everest trail it receives less visitors than many other villages in the area. It was the home of Tenzing Norgay, who was (with Sir Edmund Hillary) one of the first men to climb Mount Everest. Thame is also home of the famous Nepalese mountaineers Ang Rita Sherpa (who summited Everest at least 11 times) and Appa Sherpa (who summited Everest at least 18 times, a world record).
