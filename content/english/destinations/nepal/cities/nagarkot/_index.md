Perched high on a ridge at the North Eastern edge of the Kathmandu valley, the small settlement of Nagarkot offers an uninterrupted view of the distant Himalayan Mountain range, with Mount Everest clearly visible in good weather. Itâ€™s a great base for easy hikes or just lazing around. Views are generally best at sunrise, during the winter months from October to March but you will be very lucky to catch more than a glimpse through the monsoon clouds between June and September.
