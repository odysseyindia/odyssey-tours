Fish Tail Lodge enjoys a unique location situated on a peninsula across Fewa Lake. Shuttle-floats or boats transport you across to the resort, with its panoramic view of the Annapurna range and Mount “Machhapuchre” (Fish Tail), and their reflection on the lake. Built in the 1960s, it has hosted royalty and world leaders, and though a little faded now, it still offers a charming, unique stay with comfortable rooms and its terrific location.
