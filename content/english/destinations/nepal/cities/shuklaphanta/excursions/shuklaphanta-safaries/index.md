Suklaphanta Wildlife Reserve, which covers 305 square kilometres and protects some of the richest and most extensive grasslands in Asia, as well as both Sal and riverine forest. This mixed habitat supports an estimated 20 tigers, one of the highest densities in the world, as well as a number of other large mammals, crocodiles and a huge variety of bird life. You can take a half-day safari by jeep and on foot, full-day safaris by jeep, or guided walks looking particularly for crocodiles and birds.
