The Shuklaphanta National Park has the largest grassland in the far western Terai. It used to be a popular hunting place for the Nepalese royalty before it became a protected area. The park is home to Nepal’s – maybe even Asia’s – largest population of swamp deer. Many more species can be found in the National Park, such as tigers, rhinos, crocodiles, wild elephants and migratory birds.
