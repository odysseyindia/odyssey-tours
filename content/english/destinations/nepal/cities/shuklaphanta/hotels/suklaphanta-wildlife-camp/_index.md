Suklaphanta Camp offers 8 spacious permanent tents with shared facilities. The camp has been equipped with four shared bathrooms (4 showers and 4 toilets). There is clean running water (hot and cold) for showers, and drinking water can be obtained from the bar in the main building. Although the camp accommodation is very comfortable, please note the facilities are basic and not luxurious. However, this is unquestionably the best place to stay for access to this superb and remote reserve!
