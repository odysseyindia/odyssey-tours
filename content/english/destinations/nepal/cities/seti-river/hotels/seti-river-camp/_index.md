The Seti River Camp is set in the remote and beautiful Seti Valley. The only way to get to this river camp is by 2 and half hours rafting trip, on a grade two river rapid suitable for any age group. The camp itself is permanent and comprises Swiss-style tents, erected on raised concrete platforms, each one covered by a thatched or slated roof and with a small sit-out.  Each tent has an ensuite bathroom with hot running water. There is a communal dining area which serves freshly cooked food.
