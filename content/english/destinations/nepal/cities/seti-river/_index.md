Today, you start your rafting adventure after a drive through the countryside to Damauli, where you will familiarise yourself with your equipment and be briefed by your experienced crew.

 

The unspoilt valley of the River Seti provides not just exciting rafting, but also a chance to see village life along the banks, and look for the valley's wonderful bird-life. After a picnic lunch, you get into the rapids (only Grades 1 and 2, and only 50m at a time, so it's not very strenuous). After about 3 hours of rafting and floating, you arrive at Seti River Camp, a simple, but fun and comfortable tented camp on the banks of the river.
