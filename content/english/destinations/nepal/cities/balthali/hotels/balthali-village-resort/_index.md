Balthali Village Resort is a small, cozy retreat with a bird's eye view of green terrace fields dotted with ochre painted houses and views of the Himalayan peaks in the north horizon. This simple resort is a favourite with mountain bikers, hikers and of course, writers, and is a great place from where to trek to the Namobuddha stupa or Panauti village in the Kathmandu Valley.
