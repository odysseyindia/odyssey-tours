You will never forget your first view of the Annapurna range of the Himalayas from Pokhara. The stunning Macchapucchare, also known as "Fishtail Mountain", seems almost close enough to touch, and behind it loom the many peaks of the Annapurnas, several of them amongst the highest mountains in the world. Pokahara has a relaxed atmosphere, conducive to easy strolls and cups of tea by the lake, and enjoying the stunning views.
