The World Peace Pagoda is a massive Buddhist stupa set on top of a hill by Pokhara's Phewa Lake. You visit this impressive temple, built after the Second World War by a Japanese Buddhist monk, sickened by the violence he had seen. After your visit, you're at leisure to just relax, or to visit Pokhara's cheerful, colourful bazaar and to explore the lake. There are many boats on the lake, and you can hire one to sail or row to the island temple in the middle of the water.
