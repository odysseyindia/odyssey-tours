Nestling close by Fewa Lake in the Pokhara Valley, Temple Tree is framed by the foothills and majestic peaks of the Annapurna Mountain Range. Named after the fragrant temple tree or frangipani found here, it offers a peaceful and relaxed atmosphere, with a large swimming pool, modern but not stark rooms in stone cottages, a pair of restaurants and a well-stocked bar.
