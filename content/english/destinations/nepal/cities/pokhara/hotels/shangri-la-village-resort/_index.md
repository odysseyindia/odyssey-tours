Located at the very spot from where the first photograph was taken of the Annapurna mountain range, is the Shangri-La Village Resort, within the valley of Pokhara. Sitting beneath magnificent snow peaks, it boasts airy, spacious rooms, a swimming pool with beautiful Himalayan views, and a central location. You have a choice of cuisines in the two restaurants, and a bar, amid pleasantly green grounds.
