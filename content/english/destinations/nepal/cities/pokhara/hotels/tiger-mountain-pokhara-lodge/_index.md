Perched 1,000 feet above the Pokhara Valley with a spectacular Himalayan backdrop, the quietly luxurious Tiger Mountain Pokhara Lodge is ideal for exploring local communities, bird-watching, or just to relax. The stone cottages provide welcoming, understated seclusion with rich Tibetan rugs, handmade wood furniture, and original artwork. Large windows and glass double doors maximise the glorious views of the Annapurnas.
