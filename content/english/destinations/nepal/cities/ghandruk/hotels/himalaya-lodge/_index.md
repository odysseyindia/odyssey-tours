Located at over 6,500 feet, the Himalaya Lodge, in the shadow of the Annapurna overlooks Ghandruk, once a popular recruitment location for the Gurkha soldier regiment. Enjoy a relaxing experience here after your day's trek, with a flagstone courtyard, and a lounge with a crackling central fire. The rooms are simply furnished but comfortable, and the views are astonishing.
