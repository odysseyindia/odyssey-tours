Ghandruk (2,000m) is a mountain village set in the Modi Khola Valley. The village was once a major recruitment centre for the famous Gurkha soldiers and is the hub of the Annapurna Conservation Area Project, which promotes many varied ecological projects. Take some time to visit the Gurung museum, a tiny exhibit in an old traditional house made of stone slabs where you can learn about the history and the local way of life.
