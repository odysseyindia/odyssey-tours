In the south of the Kathmandu valley, near Pharping, is Haatiban, the site of a luxury resort surrounded by pine forests. There are sweeping views of Kathmandu down below, and the Himalayan peaks beyond on a clear day. It's a good place to base yourself for a hike up Champa Devi, one of the highest hills of the Kathmandu Valley at 2,285 meters (7,496 feet). With Hindu and Buddhist shrines at the peak, it's an important pilgrimage site on full moon days.
