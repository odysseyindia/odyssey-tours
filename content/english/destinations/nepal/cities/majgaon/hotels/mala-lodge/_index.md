Cradled in the lap of the Annapurna lowlands amongst rice terraces and a quaint bee keeping village, Mala Lodge is a sanctuary with the Machhapuchhre Mountain looming tall as if protecting it. Stone cottages with wooden beams, thick duvets and sloping natural lawns make it a very pleasant spot to be in.
