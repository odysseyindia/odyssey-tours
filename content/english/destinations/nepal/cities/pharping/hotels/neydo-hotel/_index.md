Neydo Hotel lies alongside Neydo Tashi Choeling Monastery, less than an hour's drive from Kathmandu. This is one of the most intriguing places to stay: almost 200 monks live in the monastery, and you may eat alongside them, participate in their practice, and gain insights into their life. The rooms are simple but calming, with modern bathrooms and views of the monastery or forest, and a restaurant serving healthy food.
