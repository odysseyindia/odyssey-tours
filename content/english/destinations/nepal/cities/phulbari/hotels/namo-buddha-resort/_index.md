A sweet little organic farm stay in Phulbari village, perched above the Namobuddha stupa, and surrounded by their farm and forest. An excellent place to visit with families, where children can get familiar with the buffaloes, vegetable patches, flower fields and fruit orchards where the food at the farm comes from. Also a great spot for hikes in the area, and a cosy spot to stay, with Newari architecture and pretty cottages.
