Finding stuff to do on a farm is an easy task, especially for kids. Milk a buffalo, collect fresh veggies and fruit for the day's meals, make ice cream, or just run wild. For adults, the gardens surrounding the property are wonderful opportunities to learn about local Nepali vegetation as well as different organic farming techniques and cultivated plants. There are also easy hikes and walks, and the village of Phulbari to explore.
