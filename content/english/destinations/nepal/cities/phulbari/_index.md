Phulbari (1,800m) is a quaint village close to Dhulikhel which houses the small but famous Namo Buddha stupa. It is one of the most important Buddhist pilgrimage sites in Nepal, as it is known as the place where the Buddha, in a previous life as a prince, gave his body to a starving tigress and her cubs,an act which is said to have contributed to his ability to achieve enlightenment .  A short walk above the stupa is the newly built Tibetan Buddhist monastery perched on the hilltop.
