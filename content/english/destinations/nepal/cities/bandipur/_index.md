The well-preserved medieval Newari town of Bandipur has many fine examples of 18th-century architecture, as well as small cafes, shops and temples. You can wander the cobbled streets to explore on your own. Unlike most old trading posts in the Nepal hills, Bandipur retains its cultural attributes - temples, shrines, sacred caves, innumerable festivals, and Newari architecture that harks back to the Kathmandu Valley of old.
