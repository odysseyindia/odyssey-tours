A lovely, cosy small hotel in the equally lovely, cosy and small town of Bandipur. This house has stories of ancient trans-Himalaya trade routes and of store-rooms crammed with merchandise en route from opulent India and grand Tibet. The restoration of this traditional Newari town house required keeping the low ceilings and proportions, and you'll love its charm, its stone-flagged courtyard and location in this historic town.
