Bandipur is a little rural gem, easy to explore with no cars being allowed in the old town. Stroll about exploring the medieval streets, taking in the views, and pretending to be weary so you can get a hot cuppa at a cafe or two. You can also take a hike to the picturesque village of Ramkot, which will take a few hours, with a picnic lunch en route.
