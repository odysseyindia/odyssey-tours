You can take an optional early morning sightseeing flight to Mount Everest. The flight usually lasts around an hour, and you will catch a glimpse of 20 of the highest peaks, from Langtang Lirung, the closest peak to Kathmandu, to Mt. Everest in the East, and finally fly to Chamlang peak. The mountain flight not only allows you to enjoy fantastic views but also helps you to understand the geography of Nepal.  Flights operates at all time except during the monsoon months of June and July.
