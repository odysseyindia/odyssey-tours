A very charming, traditionally-styled hotel with pretty red-brick architecture, situated in Kathmandu's lively Thamel district. The hotel offers very pleasant accommodation, and the hotel takes great pride in its eco-friendliness - it even has its own farm outside the city! The rooms feature traditional handicrafts and wooden floors, there's a lawn and a patio, and a restaurant known for a huge breakfast spread.
