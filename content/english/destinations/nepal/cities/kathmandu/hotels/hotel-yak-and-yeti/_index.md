A Kathmandu institution, this heritage hotel is walking distance from the former Royal Palace and Thamel. Once a royal palace called Lal Durbar, the hotel has expanded to its present form with a modern wing, a swimming pool, a couple of restaurants (including a famous Nepali one) and five-star service, in an air of slightly faded glory.
