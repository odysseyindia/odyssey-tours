An old Nepali building turned into a fun heritage-y hotel in the famous Thamel district. Traditional architecture shows up in the restored hand-carved pillars and stone water taps around the courtyard, the lattice windows and the local terracotta bricks on the facade. The rooms are more modern, but there's still plenty of atmosphere, and the Hub restaurant is known for great food. There is also a yoga and meditation centre.
