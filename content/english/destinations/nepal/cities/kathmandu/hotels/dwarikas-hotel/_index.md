The hotel that started the revival of traditional Newari architecture in Nepal. A beautiful red-brick building with carved wooden decor, it offers a luxurious stay in fascinating surroundings.  The linen is organically produced and hand woven. The furniture is custom designed and handmade at their own workshop, and the restaurants offer a wide variety of food, from Japanese to a regal 22-course Newari meal! A special experience.
