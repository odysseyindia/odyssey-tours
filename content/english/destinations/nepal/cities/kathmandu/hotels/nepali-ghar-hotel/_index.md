A warm, pleasant hotel in the Thamel area, modern but with lots of traditionally Newari-style wooden decor, which gives it plenty of charm. The rooms are spacious, combining contemporary facilities with wood-clad beams and red tiles for an attractive ambience, and there is a top-floor lounge and bar, and an Asian fusion restaurant. A very easy-to-like option in Kathmandu.
