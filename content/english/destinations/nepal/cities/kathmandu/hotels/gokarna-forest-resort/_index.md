Tucked away in the serene Gokarna forest, a protected sanctuary that was once a private hunting ground for Nepal's kings, the Gokarna Forest Resort offers an immersive retreat into nature just outside Kathmandu, very convenient for the airport. You'll find plenty of birds, monkeys and even deer in the golf course and forested grounds, and the comfortable rooms, good restaurants and spa make for a pleasant stay.
