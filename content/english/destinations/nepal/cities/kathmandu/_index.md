The ancient city of Kathmandu has expanded to occupy much of the Kathmandu valley, which also shelters the historic cities of Patan and Bhaktapur, and is surrounded by hills, with the Himalayan mountain range visible to the North. There is a wealth of places to see, wonderful shopping opportunities, and delicious food from around the world.
