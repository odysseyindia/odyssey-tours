Bardiya National Park is one of the most pristine conservation areas in the Terai and is home to the endangered Royal Bengal tiger and the famous One-horned rhinoceros besides countless other birds, mammals and reptiles. The national park is covered in vast Sal and riverine forests and tall elephant grass, and you can take jeep, rafting or birding safaris, and maybe even see a rare Gangetic dolphin in the Karnali river.
