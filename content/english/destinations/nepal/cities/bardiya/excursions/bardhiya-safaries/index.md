Bardiya offers a variety of ways to look for wildlife. You can go on jeep safaris, or in hand-carved boats on the Karnali river, or even on a walking safari (particularly good for birding). There are also specific birding tours available, and all excursions are accompanied by trained naturalists. Expect to see plenty of bird-life, deer and langurs, and if you're lucky, tigers, leopards and one-horned rhinos by jeep, and the gharial and mugger crocodiles on the boat safari.
