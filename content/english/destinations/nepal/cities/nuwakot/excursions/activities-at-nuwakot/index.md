Apart from just exploring and lazing around the farm itself, there are a multitude of day walks you can do nearby, like the short walk to the local village to see Nuwakot Durbar. The village however is very un-touristy and charming and well worth visiting! Otherwise, just sit back, relax and enjoy book-time and meals, and poke around the farm!
