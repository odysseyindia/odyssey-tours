Nestled in the Himalayan foothills, an imposing Newari manor house lovingly restored to its former glory. Delightful, colourful gardens with a sunny disposition offer places of peace. With authentic, village Nepal right outside the front door, and terraces of abundant organic crops, Famous Farm is the perfect place to slow down, relax and simply be at ease, particularly with a family.
