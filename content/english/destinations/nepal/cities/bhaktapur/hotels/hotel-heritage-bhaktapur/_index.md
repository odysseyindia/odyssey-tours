Heritage is a Newari-style boutique hotel influenced by the rich art and architecture of the ancient city of Bhaktapur. The hotel is a tasteful reproduction of Nepali architecture, and the rooms are carefully designed with elaborately hand-carved wooden windows, beds and mirrors. You can try Newari and Nepali cuisine in the restaurant, or relax in the garden, under the shadow of the handsome red-brick building.
