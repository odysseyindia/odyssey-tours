The massive 2015 earthquake destroyed a lot of Bhaktapur's monuments, but most have been restored, and the town contains excellent examples of Newari stone, wood sculpture and architecture. Walking on its cobbled streets past monuments like the famous Golden Gate, the Lion Gate, Art Gallery and Palace of 55 Windows, is very enjoyable, even for families.
