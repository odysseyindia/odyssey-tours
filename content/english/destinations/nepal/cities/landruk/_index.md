Landruk (1,500m) is a little village situated on a mountain's flank, in the middle of terraced rice fields. From here you have spectacular views over the surrounding countryside and the immense snowy peaks beyond. You can stop off at one of the village's tea shops to admire the view whilst sipping a cup of chai.
