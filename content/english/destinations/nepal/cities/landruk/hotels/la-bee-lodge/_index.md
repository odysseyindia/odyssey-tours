La Bee lodge is located in Landruk (5379 ft.) a typical village of the Gurung community who are also known as the famous Gurkhas. A long, low building with stunning views houses the simple, comfortable rooms, and a separate building contains a large dining hall and a lounge for relaxing. The terraced property offers plenty of space to just relax after a day's trekking.
