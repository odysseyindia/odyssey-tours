Panauti is a tiny Newari community an hour east of Kathmandu. One of the oldest Newari villages, it rejoices in its pink-brick architecture and wooden carvings, with lovely houses and temples by the river. Interestingly, the people of Panauti believe their village has been spared earthquake damage over the years because it is built on a single, large rock.
