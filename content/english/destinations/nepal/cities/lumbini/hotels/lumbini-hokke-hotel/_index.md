Built right in the temple complex, this hotel boasts comfortable but simple guest rooms that are well maintained. As it was originally built for Japanese visitors, you have a choice between Western-style and Japanese-style rooms (complete with screen doors and futons). There is a restaurant and bar, and also a swimming pool to relax in.
