Located close to Nepal's southern border with India, Lumbini is one of the four main sites of pilgrimage for Buddhists, as it is the birthplace of Gautama Buddha, the founder of Buddhism. Lumbini is a small, tranquil place with a spiritual atmosphere in keeping with its religious significance. From early morning to early evening, pilgrims from various countries perform chanting and meditation at the site.
