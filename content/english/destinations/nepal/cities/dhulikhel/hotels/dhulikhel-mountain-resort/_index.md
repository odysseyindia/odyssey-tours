Incorporating Newari architecture elements like terracotta brick facades, the Dhulikhel Mountain Resort is a pleasant, comfortable spot on the Dhulikhel ridge. The rooms are modern, comfortable and well-sized, there is a multi-cuisine restaurant, and a cheerful garden, plus a spa. A good base to explore the trekking trails around the lip of the Kathmandu valley, and with great views of the Himalayas to boot.
