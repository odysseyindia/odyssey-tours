Like the original Dwarika's in Kathmandu, the Resort showcases traditional Newari craftsmanship, but at an even more luxe level, with an airy feel that takes in the amazing views of the Himalayas. A range of suites, an infinity pool, a large spa (including a sound therapy room!), and even a farm are part of the grand experience. A wonderful getaway from Kathmandu, and a great spot to end your Nepal tour in style and comfort.
