Today, you have an easy 2 1/2 hike to the sacred pilgrimage site of Namobuddha, a stupa commemorating one of the Buddha's legendary avatars who sacrificed himself to feed a starving tigress. Your walk takes you through forests and scattered villages to the top of the hill, with prayer flags, chortens and a monastery. On a clear day, you have good views of a number of mountain peaks from here.
