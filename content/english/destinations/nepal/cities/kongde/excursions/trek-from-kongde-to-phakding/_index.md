Today, a long trek gets you back down to Phakding.     


From our high perch above the Dudh Kosi river, the trail to Phakding descends quite steeply and trekking poles are highly recommended. There is no hurry though, and along the way you have the chance to spend time in a number of small Sherpa settlements, situated off the main trail and unused to seeing trekkers.      


Finally, you reach the Everest Trail and continue your trek to Phakding.
