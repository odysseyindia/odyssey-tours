Today, you can trek to the viewpoint of Farak Ri, or relax at the lodge.

 

If you wish to make the excursion to Farak Ri (5,000m), you have an early start to catch the best views. It takes 2 to 3 hours to reach the top of this viewpoint peak. From the summit, you are treated to a panoramic view of the entire Khumbu Valley, including four of the six highest peaks in the world, namely Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, and Cho Oyu.

 

Returning to Kongde, you have lunch on the terrace with a bird's-eye view over Namche and Khumjung village. The rest of the day is free for relaxing or further walks in the area.
