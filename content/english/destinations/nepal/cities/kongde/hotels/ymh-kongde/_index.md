As the highest lodge in the world, YMH Kongde Lodge gives unparalleled views over the entire Everest range: the most amazing of the Everest lodges! The steeply-pitched red roofs and wood-panelled rooms give it character, and you can enjoy the view from the dining room, or even have a meal outside, with an unrestricted view of the mountains.
