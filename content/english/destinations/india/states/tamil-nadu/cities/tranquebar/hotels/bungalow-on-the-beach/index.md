The 19th-century Collector's Residence in picturesque Tranquebar has been transformed from a ruin into a heritage hotel by the Neemrana Group. As bungalows on the beach go, this is a pretty grand one. A stolid Danish fort looms on one side, on the other a medieval Pandya temple. There are plenty of pleasant sitouts, comfortable olde-worlde rooms and superb food, which make it a great place to relax and not do very much.
