While Pondicherry has its French legacy, Tranquebar (or Tharangambadi) is distinguished by its Danish past. It was once a sea-facing fort established for exports of spices, silks and other textiles. Its remnants include a gateway sporting the Danish Royal Seal, a peach-coloured fort, a string of imposing colonial bungalows, and two early 18th-century churches, in a charming beach location.
