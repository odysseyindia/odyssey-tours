A wonderful 6 bedroom bungalow in the Carolina Tea Estate. Situated 2.5 km from Coonoor on the Mount Pleasant side, the Tryst has an Olde English feel with rooms filled with wood and cane furniture, antiques and curios.     It is a cosy home run by a charming couple, who can advise on walks in the unspoilt areas of the Nilgiri Hills. The Tryst is therefore a perfect base for those who wish to relax in beautiful surroundings.
