A boutique hotel surrounded by lush tea gardens, Tea Nest offers gorgeous views, a sweet glass-walled restaurant, a cosy lounge and simply-furnished but comfortable rooms. Set just outside main Coonoor town, itâ€™s an easy base to explore the area, but you might find yourself too busy with tea tastings and the tea-themed food (from tea-smoked chicken salad with tea leaves to tea custard) to wander far outside.
