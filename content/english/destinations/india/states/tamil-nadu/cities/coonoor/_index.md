This charming hill station has a homely and quaint atmosphere with several vantage points from which you can get excellent views of the undulating surroundings, waterfalls and tea estates. Situated 1,858 metres above sea level, Coonoor is at a slightly lower altitude than nearby Ooty but with a similar 'British' feel, resulting from the abundance of Victorian buildings scattered around.
