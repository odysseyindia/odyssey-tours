Rajakkad Estate is a coffee and fruit plantation, best known for Palam Palace, an 18th-century Kerala house transported here and put back together like a jigsaw puzzle. While the exterior of the house is traditional, the interior is surprisingly chic, all white and cheerful. The estate offers excellent farm-to-table meals, lots of spots around the property to relax, nature walks, a lovely library, and a great sense of peace. The area also is well known for its bird watching opportunities with over 200 species of migratory birds.
