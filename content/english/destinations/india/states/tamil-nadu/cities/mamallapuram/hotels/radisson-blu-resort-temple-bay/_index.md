Boasting India's largest pool, the Radisson resort in Mamallapuram is a high-standard hotel a couple of kilometers from the temples of Mamallapuram. The meandering structure of the hotel means that most rooms are close to the pool with lawns and swaying palm trees in-between. The rooms are luxurious, with mattresses you can sink into, bathrooms you can fall asleep in and either a patio or a balcony to relax in. The d√©cor of the rooms reflects the textile heritage of southern India.
