At Mamallapuram (also known as Mahabalipuram), barely an hour's drive from Chennai, the 7th-century complex of monolithic rock-cut shrines and the legendary Shore Temple are now a World Heritage Site. The stunning archaeological remains co-exist with a long white-sand beach, making Mamallapuram a favourite destination for travellers.
