A superior hotel, part of the Taj Group of Hotels. Located right on Covelong beach, 24km north of Mamallapuram, it has luxurious rooms, villas and cottages, an excellent seafood restaurant right by the water, a swimming pool, and tennis and badminton courts. There is very much a beach resort air here, with gently rolling lawns, palm trees, a lovely spa and plenty of spots to stretch out and relax.
