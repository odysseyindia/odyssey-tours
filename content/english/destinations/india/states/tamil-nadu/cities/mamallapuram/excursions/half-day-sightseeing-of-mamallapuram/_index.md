The famous shore temple of Mamallapuram stands on the seashore with its paved forecourts. Early rock-cut temples excavated from the hillside near the centre of the village have large carved panels depicting stories from Indian mythology. Several man-made caves are scattered through the area. Then there are the rathas, "chariots", carved in situ from single boulders, to resemble temples or the chariots used in temple processions.
