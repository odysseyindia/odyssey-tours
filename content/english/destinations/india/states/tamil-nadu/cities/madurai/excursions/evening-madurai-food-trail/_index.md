Madurai is a city of surprises, its food being one of the biggest. Stroll along the area around the Meenakshi temple, and learn about Madurai's customs as you meet shopkeepers, wander through bazaars and nibble on snacks. Try a milky jigar-thanda (literally, "cools the heart"), and even a wonderful drink made from cotton seeds! Finish off with a meal at a 'mess', with meat and fish to belie Tamil Nadu's vegetarian reputation.
