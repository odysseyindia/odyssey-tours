The Meenakshi temple is one of the finest and largest examples of Dravidian architecture. Its musical pillars, each of which is carved out of a single block of granite, let out musical notes when tapped. There is also the hall of a Thousand Pillars, part of which has converted into a museum. The Thirumalai Nayak Palace is situated 1km from the temple. Built in 1636 by the king Thirumalai Nayak, it has pillars in Italian style, a Mughal arch and Dravidian decoration. The Vandiyur Mariamman Tank is a huge temple tank with a mandapam in the centre. During the 'Floating Festival' , the temple deities are taken out in the tank on floats.
