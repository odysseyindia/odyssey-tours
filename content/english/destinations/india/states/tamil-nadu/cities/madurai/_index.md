Full of colourful bazaars, street tailors, throngs of pilgrims and joyful religious processions, Madurai is a bustling city that attracts thousands of visitors each day. Madurai's main attraction is the famous temple dedicated to the Goddess Meenakshi. Each evening, there is a closing ceremony, accompanied by chanting priests, drummers and torchbearers in which an image of Shiva is carried in procession to Parvati's bedroom.
