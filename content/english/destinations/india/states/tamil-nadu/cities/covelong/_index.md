Covelong is a fishing settlement 37km south of Chennai, and 24km north of Mamallapuram along a very good highway. Here, an ancient fort has been converted into the Taj Group's luxurious Fisherman's Cove Resort. Further south and just 15km before Mamallapuram is the Madras Crocodile Bank. This successful breeding farm augments the crocodile population of India's wildlife sanctuaries.
