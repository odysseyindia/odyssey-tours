Right in the centre of Trichy, visible for miles around, is the Rock Fort temple, reached by climbing up a tunnel of 437 steps to a splendid view, especially of the Srirangam Temple. This superb 13th-century temple complex with colourful bazaars has 21 carved gopurams or temple archways and is set on a 250-hectare island in the Cauvery, connected to the mainland by a bridge.
