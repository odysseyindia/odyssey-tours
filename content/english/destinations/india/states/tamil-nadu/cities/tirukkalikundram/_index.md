About 14km west of Mamallapuram, Tirukkalikundram is a pilgrimage centre with the hilltop Vedagirishvara Temple dedicated to Shiva. You climb the 550 smooth steps to the hilltop bare-footed. Once there, you have excellent views over the surrounding countryside. According to legend, two eagles come here each day at noon from Varanasi, a good 2,000km away, to be fed by the priests - but you might be disappointed.
