This lovely walking tour is less about monuments and more about stories. It is an easy walk through Mylapore, the old part of Chennai, exploring fascinating stories hidden away in the mundane rituals of daily life. You hear the stories behind everyday sights, stories of gods and demons, of ancient customs and symbolisms, and of Mylapore and Madras, and end with a delicious snack at a local eatery.
