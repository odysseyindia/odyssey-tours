Formerly known as Madras, this is the capital of the state of Tamil Nadu. Chennai boasts of one of the longest city beaches in the world, and Marina Beach provides a refreshing contrast to the busy city centre. The Fort St. George area contains many reminders from the time the British established the East India Trading Company in the 17th century, including the oldest surviving Anglican church in Asia, the St. Mary's Church.
