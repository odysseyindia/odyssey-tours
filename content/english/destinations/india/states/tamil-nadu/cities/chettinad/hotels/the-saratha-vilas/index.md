A lovely, low-slung Chettiar mansion restored by a pair of French architects, Saratha Vilas elegantly places traditional architecture alongside modern touches. The rooms are cosy and comfortable, there is a cooking class you can take part in, and the pool area is inviting - especially after a day of cycling round the villages of Chettinad.
