The Chettiar's main intent was to make his house a statement of his social success and he put everything into it: look out for Spanish tiles, Italian marble floors, Venetian chandeliers, and carved friezes. Many mansions are open to the public for a small fee. These houses are spread across pleasant villages, separated by palm-lined roads and paddy fields, easy to explore on your own in a car, or even on foot or by bicycle. You can also visit the tile-makers in Athangudi, creators of beautiful, colourful tiles for a century.
