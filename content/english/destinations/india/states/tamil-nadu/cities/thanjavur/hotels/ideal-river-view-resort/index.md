A sprawling hotel, Ideal River View Resort is located in a secluded spot along the banks of a river 3km from Thanjavur. The resort has large air-conditioned rooms in two-storeyed cottages, and a swimming pool. The rooms are kept cool by the smooth stone floors, the chunky-legged beds are comfortable and the chairs are often quaintly cane backed. All rooms have a small balcony overlooking the gardens and river.
