Within its enormous compound, the chief attraction of the Brihadishwara Temple complex is the main temple. The temple consists of an octagonal cupolic dome, resting on a single square block of granite estimated to weigh 80 tonnes. The moulded plinth is extensively engraved with inscriptions. On the walls of the inner passages are life-size iconographic representations of various Hindu deities. A huge nandi bull faces the inner sanctum. Created from a single piece of rock, it weighs 25 tonnes and is one of India's largest Nandi statues.
