Tanjore Hi is a beautifully restored 1920s merchant mansion, a short walk from the Brahidishwara temple. The contemporary, individually-styled rooms  are all in blue, and all fairly small but comfortable. The hotel has a fun restaurant on the top floor, the Chola, with views over Thanjavur city. The food is made-to-order, using as many fresh and organic products as possible.
