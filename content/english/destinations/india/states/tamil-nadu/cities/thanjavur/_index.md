The chief attraction of Thanjavur (or Tanjore) is the extraordinary Brihadishwara Temple. Built in 1010 by the Chola dynasty, who ruled much of Southern India for over 400 years, the temple is now a World Heritage monument. The immense main temple is over 60m high, and is hewn from a single piece of granite estimated to weigh 80 tonnes. An astonishing sight, one of the highlights of a trip to South India.
