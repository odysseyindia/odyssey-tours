Ancient Kanchipuram, the city of a thousand temples, is one of the seven most sacred pilgrim centres for Hindus, and still contains some 126 temples. The city was the capital of the Cholas as far back as the 2nd century BC and a Pallava capital between the 6th and 8th centuries. This town is also known for the best silk sarees in the country, made by the descendants of weavers who settled here over 400 years ago.
