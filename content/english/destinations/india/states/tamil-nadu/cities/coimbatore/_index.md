Coimbatore is known as the textile capital of South India or the 'Manchester of the South'. The first textile mills came up as far back as 1888 but there are now over a hundred mills. The result has been a strong economy and a reputation as one of the greatest industrial cities in South India. Coimbatore serves as an entry and exit point to neighbouring Kerala and the popular hill station of Ootacamund (Ooty).
