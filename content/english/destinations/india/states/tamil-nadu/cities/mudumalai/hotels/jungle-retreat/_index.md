Jungle Retreat offers accommodation in country style cottages with sprawling private verandahs that afford spectacular views of the surrounding hills and tropical jungles.     The resort is owned and run by the Mathias family who has an extensive knowledge of the area. There is no television, no telephone and no music in the rooms to disturb the peace and quiet of the surroundings. This creates an atmosphere of utter serenity, which is as refreshing as it is rare.
