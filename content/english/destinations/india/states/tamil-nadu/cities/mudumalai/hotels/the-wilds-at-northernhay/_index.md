On the very edge of Mudumalai, a wild life sanctuary in the Nilgiris is The Wilds at Northernhay, an ancestral coffee plantation spread across 98 acres of wilderness.     Once a coffee warehouse where some of the world's finest coffee was stored, the House in the Wilds now provides a number of comfortable bedrooms, opening onto a common verandah, a drawing room, a dining room, and several charming areas where you may relax.
