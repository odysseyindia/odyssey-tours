Kanyakumari is India's 'land's end', the southernmost tip of the mainland, at the confluence of the Indian Ocean, Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal. Kanyakumari is the only place in India where one can watch the sun set and moon rise simultaneously on a full moon evening.The Vivekananda Rock Memorial stands on an offshore rock, in memory of the philosopher Swami Vivekananda, who would come and contemplate here.
