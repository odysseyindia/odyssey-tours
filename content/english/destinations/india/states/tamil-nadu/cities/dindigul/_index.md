Dindigul is a large market town that handles the produce of the surrounding hills, mainly fruit, including a renowned local variety of banana. Dindigul is particularly known for its cheroots (cigars). A massive granite fort towers above the town and presents magnificent views of the town, the valley and the hills on either side.
