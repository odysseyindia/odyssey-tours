Today is at leisure at Cardamom House. If you want to be active, we recommend walking, photography, birding, flower identification, sketching and painting, or yoga. They have some identification books and binoculars available, a telescope to wonder at the night skies and some yoga mats. You can also take a village walk, which generally takes place in the morning. You might visit a spice mill, go shopping in the market, have a coffee in the square, go into a home or visit a field temple. You can arrange these at the hotel.
