Elephant Valley is a wonderful resort at the edge of the forest. The cottages have been tastefully created using local granite and reclaimed Burma teak wood, with interiors of colonial and art deco furniture. Set close to a reserve forest, you will find yourself surrounded by birds and beautiful trees, and might even spot elephants! Short and long hikes are easily possible, and there are both great views and great food.
