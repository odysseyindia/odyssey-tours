Elephant Valley lies along the migration route of the pachyderms, and they are often found close to the resort. Follow nature trails of various lengths to admire the tremendous biodiversity of the region. Around varieties of wild orchids, old palms and ferns, you may see bisons, elephant families, and other smaller mammals. Some rare bird species can be seen here, like the majestic black eagle and the sweet Malabar whistler. You can do a full-day trek, or shorter treks, or even just a fascinating walk around the property, including a rope bridge and a riverside walk. You can book all of these on the spot at the hotel.
