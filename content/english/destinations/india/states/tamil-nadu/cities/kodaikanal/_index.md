Kodaikanal's cool temperatures and the beautiful scent of pine and eucalyptus make it a popular retreat from the plains. Set at a high altitude, a journey to Kodai affords breathtaking views of the hills and valleys. Kodaikanal has many Raj-era houses and flower-filled gardens add atmosphere, while many quiet paths lead through the forests to spectacular waterfalls and viewpoints.
