Pollachi is a small agricultural town just over an hour from Coimbatore. A pleasantly green place, it is located close to the Western Ghats, a critical biodiversity region. It offers a good base from which to explore wildlife reserves like Topslip and Parambikulam, and is also a good mid-way halt between the hill stations of Tamil Nadu and the tea estates of Kerala.
