One of Tamil Nadu's most important holy towns, Chidambaram was the capital of the Chola empire for 400 years. The great Nataraja temple, dedicated to the dancing Shiva, was built during this period, and is one of the finest examples of Dravidian architecture. This huge complex is still an active temple, with Brahmins at every shrine. A visit to the temple affords a fascinating glimpse into ancient Tamil religious practice.
