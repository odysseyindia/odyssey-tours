The Savoy makes the best of its colonial heritage with very pukka British activities: high tea, croquet and letter-writing are on offer here, along with more modern pursuits like tea mixology. There's plenty for kids to do, from pony rides to feeding animals. The more active might like to visit nearby tribal villages, do a spot of birding, or hike to Lamb's Rock or the vantage point of Doddabetta. Wellness is also taken care of, with yoga and a luxurious spa on the premises.
