Trace the remnants of the British colonial era such as St. Stephen’s Church, the Nilgiris’ oldest church built in 1829, and the beautifully terraced Botanical Gardens, established in 1848, a living gallery of the Nilgiris’ natural flora.     


Go for a stroll in the Rose Garden, with over 20,000 rose bushes of more than 2,000 varieties (best between May and July), from where you can also enjoy the views over Ooty.  On clear days, you can get even better views at Doddabetta, about 7 km east of Ooty, which is the highest point (2633m) in the Nilgiris.    


An added attraction for travellers to Ooty is the toy train journey which winds its way up the mountain from Mettupulayam in 4 to 5 hours. You can drive to nearby Coonoor and take the toy train back up to Ooty for a shorter train ride.
