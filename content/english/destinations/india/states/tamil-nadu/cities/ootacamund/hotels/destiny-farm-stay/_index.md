A unique resort set across two hills and a lake, amidst the wilderness of the Nilgiri biosphere. With a spa, horses, a working farm, and with loads to do, Destiny is a holiday experience in Ooty unlike any other.    A completely self-sufficient farm that employs state of the art eco-friendly methods of cultivation, the huge stretch of land at Destiny produces a wealth of vegetables, dairy products and fruits. You can explore this working farm that produces fresh carrots, cabbages and tubers, exotic herbs and even English vegetables like artichokes. Wander into the clean well-maintained dairy when the cows are not on their daily walkabout and meet the workers and supervisors in the farm, all locals, who are as passionate as they are experienced in the various aspects of agriculture. Owners Meeta and Vijay Prabhu are often on hand, chatting to guests and tending to their vegetables.    Destiny Farm's most magnificent residents are their stunning horses who are available for a delightful cross country ride.
