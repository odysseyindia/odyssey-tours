Originally a Toda tribal village, Ooty (or Udhagamandalam) was established as a hill resort by the British in the 19th century. It has a lingering touch of the Raj in the English cottages, clubs, boarding schools and churches. Ooty is spread over a large area amongst rolling hills and valleys, with a lovely lake and racecourse. There are also Botanical Gardens here with immaculate lawns housing hundreds of varieties of plants.
