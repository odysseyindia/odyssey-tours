The best place to stay in Ooty. High on the slopes of a hill, the Savoy, operated by the Taj hotels, sprawls over six acres of landscaped gardens, offering colonial-style cottages built between 1834 and 1865. The rooms have a colonial atmosphere with working fireplaces, wooden floors and brass fittings. Colorful flowerbeds merge to form a multi-coloured quilt around the cottages, adding to the old English Charm.
