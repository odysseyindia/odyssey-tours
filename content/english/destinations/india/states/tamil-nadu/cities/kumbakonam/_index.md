Legend has it that the Hindu god Shiva broke a kumbh (water pot) here, after it was brought here by a great flood. As a result this busy market town has many large and colourful temples dedicated to Shiva, some with highly refined Chola stone carving. Nearby at Darasuram is a magnificent 12th-century Chola temple, which should not be missed. The village of Swamimalai, just a bike ride away, is the state's principal centre for traditional bronze-casting.
