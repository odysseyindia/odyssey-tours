Indeco Swamimalai is less a hotel and more a cross between a cultural village and an eccentric, wonderful museum. The reception building is an old lighthouse, transferred stone by stone from Chennai, and now contains a museum of British-era artifacts, alongside many others around the property. The rooms are large and stuffed with curios, the vegetarian food is excellent, and there are plenty of activities available.   There are innumerable statues and artifact collections here, as well as a deer enclosure, a space for ducks, a special outdoor dining table with piped 'rain' for the summers, a swimming pool made to resemble a temple tank, and even the vast blue gate of the old Madras Central Jail!
