Near the temple town of Kumbakonam, Mantra Koodam is designed like an ‘agraharam’ - a characteristically Brahmin street lined with ‘illams’ (homes). The cottages are designed like traditional Tamil homes – with large verandahs, Athangudi floor tiles, ornate Burmese teak doors and open-to-air bathrooms. Strolling through the property, you will come across lush coconut groves, temple shrines and the occasional peacock.
