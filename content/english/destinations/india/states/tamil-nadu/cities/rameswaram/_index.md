The sacred island town of Rameswaram at the extreme south-eastern limit of the Indian peninsula has one of India's most venerated temples. A fine example of South Indian architecture, the temple is renowned for its many pillared corridors, about 1220m in length. According to Hindu epic 'Ramayana', Rama sanctified this place by worshipping Lord Shiva here, after the war against Ravana.
