Tamil Nadu has all that a visitor could look for. A dramatic coastline, beautiful beaches and dense forests. Apart from this, Tamil Nadu has also some of India's most magnificent temples, many still active centres of religious practice.     The magnificent temples and their towering gopurams (entrance towers) dominate the landscape just as Hindu religion permeates Tamil life.
