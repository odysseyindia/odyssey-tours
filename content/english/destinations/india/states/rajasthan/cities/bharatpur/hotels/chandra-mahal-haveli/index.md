A charming 19th century haveli in a rural setting, 25 km from Bharatpur. Constructed in Mughal style with scalloped arches in red stone and beautiful white stuccoed walls, there is a central courtyard with a marble fountain and numerous balconies. There are 23 rooms, fairly small and simple but nicely decorated with Rajasthani fabrics.
