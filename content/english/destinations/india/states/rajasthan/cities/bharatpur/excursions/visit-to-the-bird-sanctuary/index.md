Keoladeo Ghana is one of the worldâ€™s finest bird sanctuaries. The best time to visit is in the early mornings and late afternoons, when the birds are most active. The best way to tour the park is by cycle rickshaw, as the drivers are all trained birding guides; you can also walk on the smaller trails. When there is enough water, you can also take a row-boat ride, to get close to the aquatic birds and their nesting colonies
