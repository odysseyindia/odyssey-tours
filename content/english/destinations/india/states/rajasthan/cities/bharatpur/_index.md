Bharatpur is famous for its bird sanctuary, Keoladeo Ghana National Park. A network of paths, trails and lagoons, this is home to hundreds of species of birds. In winter, the resident population of birds is enhanced by many species of migratory birds. Bharatpur is a beautiful, peaceful place, enjoyable even for non-birders, as motorised vehicles are not allowed, and it can be explored on foot, bicycle or cycle rickshaw.
