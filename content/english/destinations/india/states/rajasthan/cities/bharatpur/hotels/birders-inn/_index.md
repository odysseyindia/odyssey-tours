Located next to the entrance gate of the bird sanctuary, Birder's Inn is a quiet, peaceful haven with a friendly atmosphere, great for the keen birdwatcher. The spacious air-conditioned rooms overlook a garden with fruit trees that attract various birds. There is a large restaurant and a small swimming pool, and their naturalists are always available to accompany visits to the bird sanctuary.
