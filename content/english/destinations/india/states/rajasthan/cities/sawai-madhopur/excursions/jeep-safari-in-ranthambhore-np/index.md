  - Jeep safari in Ranthambhore N.P
---
A jeep safari can provide a more intimate experience of Ranthambhore National Park than the larger safari vehicles. The shared jeeps accommodate up to 6 people, plus a naturalist. This is one of the best places in India in which to see a tiger in the wild, though of course wildlife sightings are always a matter of luck. Most often seen are the varieties of deer and much birdlife.
