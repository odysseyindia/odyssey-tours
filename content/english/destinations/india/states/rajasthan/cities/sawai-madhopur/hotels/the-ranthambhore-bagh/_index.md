A simple, rustic resort set in a pleasant garden with many full-grown trees. The accommodation is in 12 delightful, comfortable large tents, all with attached modern bathrooms. In the summer months of May and June, when the tents become too hot, the basic rooms are used instead. The resort is run by Aditya, an award-winning wildlife photographer, and his wife Poonam, a sculptress. They encourage a very convivial atmosphere, making this a good place to meet wildlife enthusiasts and discuss the future of tigers and wildlife in general. More than 150 different species of birds have been sighted in the garden, and they are still counting!
