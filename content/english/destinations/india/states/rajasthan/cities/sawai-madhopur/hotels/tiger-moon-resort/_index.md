A rustic cottage-style wildlife resort in an appealing jungle ambience. There is a central dining hall which overlooks the natural looking swimming pool. The naturalists here are most knowledgeable and the resort operates safaris in their own vehicles. Your stay is on full board and includes 2 park safaris per day by jeep/canter.
