  - Visit of Ranthambhore Fort
---
This is a 1,000-year-old fort at the periphery of the National Park, with a spectacular combination of Rajput and Mughal architecture. From the parking area at the base of the fort, a climb of 400 steps winds through various gates to a plateau dotted with ruined palaces, tombs, and a popular Ganesh temple. There are fabulous views over the park, and this is also a great place for birdwatching.
