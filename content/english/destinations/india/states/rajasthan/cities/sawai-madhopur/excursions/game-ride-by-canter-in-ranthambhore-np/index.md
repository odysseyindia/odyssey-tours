  - Game ride by canter in Ranthambhore NP

Ranthambore National Park is one of the best places in India in which to see a tiger in the wild, though of course wildlife sightings are always a matter of luck.  More often seen are the varieties of deer and much birdlife. The varied landscapes within the park are attractive and the wildlife safari by purpose-built safari vehicles accommodating up to 20 people is an enjoyable experience even if wildlife proves elusive.
