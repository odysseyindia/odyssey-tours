The busy, dusty town of Sawai Madhopur is the base for visiting the beautiful Ranthambhore National Park, with various accommodation options along the road between the town and park entrance. The landscape is more open than in many other parks, making tiger sightings more frequent. Other wildlife includes sambhar, nilgai, sloth bear, jackal, crocodile, much bird life, and even some leopards.
