Ranthambore National Park is one of the best places in India in which to see a tiger in the wild. The varied landscapes within the park are attractive and the wildlife safari by shared jeep is an enjoyable experience even if wildlife proves elusive. Morning safaris usually start at around 06:00, and afternoon safaris at around 14:00, and usually last for 3 to 4 hours.
