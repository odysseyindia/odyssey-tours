Once the site for temporary tents for the local aristocrat's hunting parties, Chhatra Sagar is now a permanent, luxurious site by a dam in Nimaj, Rajasthan.  The cottages are made to resemble tents, but are extremely comfortable, with permanent bathrooms and great views over the reservoir. Chhatra Sagar is great for birding in high luxury, with a restaurant, safaris, picnics, sundowners, yoga and wellness cuisine on offer.
