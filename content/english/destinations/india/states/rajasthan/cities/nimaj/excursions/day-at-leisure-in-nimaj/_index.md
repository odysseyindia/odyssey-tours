The main activity at Nimaj is bird-watching. The Chhatra Sagar water reservoir is home to a large number of aquatic birds. You can see ducks, waterfowl and huge numbers of pelicans and daintily stepping flamingoes right in front of your tent. The resort also organizes some special bird-watching trips further afield for those interested.    You can also join a safari to a working plantation with fields of wheat, mustard, cotton and chilies. It is a great way to experience first-hand the traditional methods of farming and be a guest in some of the picturesque village homes.
