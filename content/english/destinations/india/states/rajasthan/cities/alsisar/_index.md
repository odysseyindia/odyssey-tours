The village of Alsisar is 23 km from the district headquarter Jhunjhunu in the Shekhawati district of Rajasthan. It is home to the Alsisar Mahal, a fort converted into a hotel which has now become an ideal base to explore not only the old historic capital of Jhunjhunu but also the whole painted region of Shekhawati.
