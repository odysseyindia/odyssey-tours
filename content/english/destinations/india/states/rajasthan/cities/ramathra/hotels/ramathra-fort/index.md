In a spectacular rural location is the hilltop Ramathra Fort. It now houses a fabulous heritage hotel, with luxury tents in the garden, and suites built into the fort walls. These offer modern comforts and superb views over the countryside, which is surprisingly fertile, owing to the many rivers and canals. Bird life is plentiful, and the unspoilt surrounding areas can be explored by jeep, boat, bicycle, or on foot, which you can book directly at the hotel.
