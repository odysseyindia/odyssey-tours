Your stay in Ramathra Fort includes a village walk and boating at sunset. There are a variety of species of birds seen around the Fort & Lake. Bird watching can be done at the lake, at the marshes below the fort or during your walk to the village.    


You can also book, at extra cost, a jeep safari to surrounding villages, a night drive in the jungle to watch for wildlife, or a camel cart ride. It is also possible to ask for a full body massage by local masseurs on day beds on the rampart of the fort or to learn Indian-style cooking on wood-fire chullas.
