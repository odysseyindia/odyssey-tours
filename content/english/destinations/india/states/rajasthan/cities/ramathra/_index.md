Ramathra is part of a green farming belt in the Kalisil River valley. The Daang plateau, stretching east to the Chambal River valley and as far as Ranthambhore to the south, is filled with gorges. Until recently, tigers roamed the area as did notorious bandits. Today, tigers are rare and the bandits only legendary, but visitors regularly see deer, blue bulls, wolves jackals, hyenas and, if lucky, a wild boar, bear or leopard.
