Castle Bijaipur has a number of excursions available, most of which are perfect if you like a little adventure; these include a jeep safari, horse riding, cycling, trekking, bird watching and village walks. They will also put on cooking demos, organise yoga classes, and give you the chance to visit a local Gujjar family. All these activities can be booked directly at the hotel.
