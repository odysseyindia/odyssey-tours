Samode is a small village nestled among rugged hills, where narrow cobbled streets curve up till you reach the fairytale palace. This superbly restored 18th-century palace was put on the map by its starring role in the 1984 mini-series `The Far Pavilions'. Coming from Jaipur, Samode is the gateway to the famous Shekhawati region. The palace itself has several frescoes - original and also redone, in many of its public areas.
