Spend the day exploring the quaint village of Samode on foot or camel back or simply relax and enjoy a picnic lunch in the mango orchard of the nearby Samode Bagh (the garden resort).  For those with energy to burn, you can climb the 376 steps beside the Palace to the Samode Fort that once protected Samode. The climb is steep but the views across the valley make it worth the effort.  Alternatively, you can relax at either the magnificent main pool or the more discreet roof terrace pool, or enjoy an Ayurvedic massage.
