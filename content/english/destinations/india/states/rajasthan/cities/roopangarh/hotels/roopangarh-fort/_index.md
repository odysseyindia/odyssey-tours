Roopangarh Fort is a 17th century hilltop fort of the royal family of Kishangarh, famous for its school of miniature painting.     The fort offers some of the largest rooms found in Rajasthan. They are filled with the usual royal Rajasthani artefacts - but their setting in such grandeur makes them extra special. Several of the rooms have colourful frescoes and chandeliers, impressive antiques and some nice art work.
