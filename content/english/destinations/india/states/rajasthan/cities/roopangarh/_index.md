Roopangarh was an important fort founded in the mid 17th century on the old caravan route. The town is a centre for crafts industries such as leather embroidery, block printing, pottery and handloom weaving. Located high above the town, Roopangarh fort is a magnificent sight. Within its nine turret fortifications are foundries, armouries, granaries, elaborate underground passages, jails and palaces.
