The small village of Junia, midway Ajmer and Jaipur, was founded in the 14th century by Maharaja Sajjan Singh. This interesting and undisturbed village offers an excellent insight into the life of rural India, its people and occasional festivals. Migratory ducks and numerous wild birds inhabit the lake and the gardens making Junia a bird watcher's paradise. The Soklia Great Indian Bustard Sanctuary is a short drive away.
