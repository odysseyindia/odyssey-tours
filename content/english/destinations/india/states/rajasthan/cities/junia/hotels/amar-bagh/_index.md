The 18th century Amar Bagh residence offers a true taste of rural India. Situated on the lakeside of the village of Junia, the building has 4 basic but comfortable rooms in the old building and some new ones in a nearby plantation. The village of Junia is laid back and the guests can freely wander around amongst the friendly villagers.
