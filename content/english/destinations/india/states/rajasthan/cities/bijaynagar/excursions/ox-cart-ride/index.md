This is a fun way to explore the rural surroundings of Bijay Niwas Palace. Perched on the ox cart, you pass varied orchards and fields. You stop to visit a couple of villages on foot, and are usually invited into one of the houses to enjoy some tea. Most of the villagers are farmers, so you will find plenty of goats and cows around, and even inside, the houses, making for a colourful rural experience.
