A charming building right on the banks of the holy Pushkar lake. The former palace of the Maharaja of Kishangarh has green gardens and the verandahs overlooking the lake, temples and ghats. The hotel's owner is a great collector of antique furniture, and all rooms have hand-picked features. Large armoires with cut glass handles, carved mirror frames, and other smaller pieces of colonial or Rajasthani furniture are a delight.
