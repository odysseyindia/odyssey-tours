Pushkar Lake is the centerpiece of the small town. It’s a sacred lake for Hindus and has a rare temple dedicated to Brahma. Rituals and offerings happen throughout the day at the lake and at night huge Aarti ceremonies take place.    When you wander through the bazaar, only a block back from the lake, you’ll find numerous gem shops, souvenir stalls and street food vendors. A short hike to either the Savitri Temple or Pap Mochani Temple provides panoramic views of Pushkar and the holy lake.
