The town of Pushkar clings to the side of beautiful Pushkar Lake, considered very holy by Hindus. Hundreds of small temples are built on the periphery of the lake with wide stone steps or `ghats' leading down to the lake. A magical quality of light hovers over the lake, bouncing off the surrounding white-washed temples and bathing ghats. At sunset, Pushkar turns into one of the most exotic places on earth.
