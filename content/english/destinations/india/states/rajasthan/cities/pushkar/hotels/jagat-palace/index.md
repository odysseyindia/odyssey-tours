Jagat Palace is a newly built 'palace' that uses rescued carvings and has amazing stone-work. The rooms have interesting period furniture and traditional hand-painted borders around the ceilings. A little outside Pushkar, Jagat Palace greets you with a massive carved stone entranceway and peaceful gardens. Behind the hotel building is a large swimming pool with a spacious deck.
