There is a lot to do in and around the palace at Dungarpur. The beautifully designed swimming pool borders the lake beyond and has some fabulous carved statues around it, a great place to relax or do some lazy bird-watching. The palace also has a central courtyard with a most unusual structure - Ek Khambiya mahal - a miniature tower intricately carved in deep grey stone with contrasting accents in white marble. This central courtyard gives the palace a totally unique identity.    Udai Bilas Palace's private museum, Ajaibghar, has a lovely collection of artifacts, paintings, garments and arms, which brings alive the Dungarpur state and its first family. The display reflects the whimsy inherent in an ajaibghar or house of wonder, as museums used to be known in India.     Guests of Udai Bilas can visit the 13th-century Juna Mahal (Old Palace). The walls of this palace are adorned with exquisite frescoes, miniatures, glass and mirror inlay work. Founded in the 13th century, it remained the familyâ€™s residence until the early 20th century and the building of Udai Bilas Palace, making Juna Mahal the longest continuously-inhabited fort-palace in India.    Another attraction is the Dungarpur Mews, a 100-year-old heritage building, initially used to stable horses and carriages and then extended into a huge garage in the 1930s. The current owner, Harsh Vardhan, has spruced up the old building to showcase some old carriages used in the pre-independence era, some old British cannons, a great collection of vintage cars, a couple of WW1 BMW motorcycles, and even two DH-5 aircraft! The Mews has a nice bar with music and it is a great place to party in the midst of all the old cars and other modes of transport. The garage is full of automobile memorabilia that auto buffs will love!
