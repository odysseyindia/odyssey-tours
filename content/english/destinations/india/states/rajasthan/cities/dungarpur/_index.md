Dungarpur has one of the finest palaces in Rajasthan, the 19th-century Udai Bilas Palace, now a heritage hotel. The palace is located on the shore of a peaceful lake, which attracts a large number of aquatic birds like pelicans and spoonbills. Guests of Udai Bilas can also visit the 13th-century Juna Mahal (Old Palace). The walls of this palace are adorned with exquisite frescoes, miniatures, glass and mirror inlay work.
