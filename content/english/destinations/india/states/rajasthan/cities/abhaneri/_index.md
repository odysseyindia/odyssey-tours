Just off the Jaipur-Agra highway is the village of Abhaneri. Here you will see the ruins of the 10th-century Harshat Mata Temple, with interesting stone carvings, and the impressive Chand Baoli Step Well. Such wells can be found throughout the desert state of Rajasthan, to provide access to the precious commodity of water; this is one of the largest and best-preserved.
