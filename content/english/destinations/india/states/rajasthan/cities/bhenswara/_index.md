Bhenswara is a small, colourful village in a little-visited part of southwest Rajasthan. It is a Rajput country estate whose 'castle' has been converted into an attractive heritage hotel. The owners organise interesting village safaris into outlying areas including Bhil tribal villages and Rabari pastoral settlements, and night drives by jeep to spot leopards.
