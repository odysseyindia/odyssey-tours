The region around Bhenswara is home to some of the more pastoral tribes of India. You take a jeep safari to these villages to experience the lifestyle of the tribals, which is in complete harmony with nature. The rock-strewn region of Bhenswara is also the natural habitat for panthers and your host at Bhenswara is a keen panther watcher. You can enjoy a thrilling evening safari to try and get a glimpse of this elusive animal.
