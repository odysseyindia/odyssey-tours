Kesroli is the site of a 16th-century hill fort, converted by the Neemrana Hotels into a heritage hotel. With seven proud turrets, the fort dominates the country-side and the views from the ramparts is panoramic. The Hill Fort has spacious rooms, all furnished in the old Rajasthani style using local fabrics. Located near Alwar, Kesroli is a perfect base for visiting Sariska Tiger Reserve and the summer palaces at Deeg.
