A rugged 14th century fort converted by the Neemrana Hotels into a heritage hotel. With seven proud turrets, the Kesroli Hill fort dominates the surrounding country-side and the views from the fort ramparts is panoramic and impressive. The Hill Fort has 23 rooms, all furnished in the old Rajasthani style using local fabrics.
