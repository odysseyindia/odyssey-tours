Situated some 120km from Udaipur, Dhariyawad is known for its 16th-century castle, now a heritage property with a medieval flavour. The rooms are basic but all have modern amenities. Surrounded by thick forests and a tribal Bhil village known for its silversmiths, this region remains quite unspoilt. The fort provides opportunities for tribal village tours and jungle visits into the nearby Sitamata wildlife sanctuary.
