A16th century fort in a peaceful location, close to a river and on the edge of a thickly forested  nature park, the Sitamata Wildlife Reserve. This homely heritage hotel is run by the resident ruling family. The rooms are in the main fort building and some in a cluster of cottages. All rooms are basic but comfortably furnished with locally made furniture and ethnic fabrics.
