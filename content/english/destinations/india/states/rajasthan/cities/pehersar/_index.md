Located 25 km from the bird sanctuary at Bharatpur, Peharsar (Paharsar) is a quaint village which offers its visitors a peek into a “real” India. It’s a tiny village with just a small village store or two and a small local school. As of date, there are approximately 200 households, with a population of about 1,500. Almost entirely an agriculture driven economy, the extremely fertile soil is perfect for growing wheat, Mustard, Jawar, Bajra and various vegetables which the villagers use for self-consumption.
