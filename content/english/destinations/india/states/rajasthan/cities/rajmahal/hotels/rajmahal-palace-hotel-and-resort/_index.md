A 300-year old palace with eight guest rooms. Care has been taken to preserve the original character of the rooms. The rooms have been decorated in traditional Rajasthani style, using period furnishings. As far as possible, an effort has been made to keep the original wall paintings intact. The rooms have all modern amenities and attached baths.
