Located just outside Kumbhalgarh Wildlife Sanctuary, Ghanerao houses the red sandstone walls of Royal Castle Ghanerao, built in the 17th century. The villlage is at the entrance to one of the few passes through the Aravalli Hills. There are many temples, step-wells and arched gateways, and the fertile tracts of the settlement are green. Ghanerao is well placed for visits to Kumbhalgarh fort and the Ranakpur temples.
