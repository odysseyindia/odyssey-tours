A rustic 17th-century castle set in the Aravalli hills. It has marble pavilions, pleasant courtyards around a swimming pool, faded paintings, wells, elephant stables and walls marked with cannon-fire. The castle has partly turned into a hotel, simply decorated in the local style, with lots of sitouts and verandahs. The other part is used by the present generation of the royal family.
