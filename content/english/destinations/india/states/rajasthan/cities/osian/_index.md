This ancient town northwest of Jodhpur in the Thar Desert contains the largest group of 8th to 10th-century Hindu and Jain temples in Rajasthan. The temples are grouped in several sites around the town and the oldest exhibit extensive carvings. Not too far away from the temples are some of the most impressive sand dunes of Rajasthan, stretching mile after smooth mile, perfect for a camel safari.
