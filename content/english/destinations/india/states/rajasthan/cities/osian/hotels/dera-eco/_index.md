A tented camp in a remote area of the Thar desert, Dera Eco is situated in a fabulous location next to rolling sand dunes.     This camp features 16 well furnished tents with attached bathrooms, a dining area and bar. Each tent has a small patio, made of packed earth, complete with a cover and comfortable chairs.    The camel safaris are operated by local farmers who are cheerful and friendly and know the ship of the desert like no one else.
