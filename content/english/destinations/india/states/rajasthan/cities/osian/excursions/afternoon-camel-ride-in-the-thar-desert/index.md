  - Afternoon camel ride in the Thar desert
---
A camel ride to the sand dunes is a thrilling experience. You pass small settlements, and may see chinkara deer, and various birdlife, as your camel deftly navigates the sandy paths. The ride ends on top of a spectacular sand dune from where you can enjoy the sunset before returning to the camp by jeep.
