A unique place, stunningly located by a lake in the Aravalli hills, Lakshman Sagar offers supreme comfort in natural surroundings. Designed to blend into the rocky terrain, there are 12 tasteful villas, set well apart, with plunge pools and spectacular views. The rock swimming pool is a major attraction, and there are many nooks and crannies. There's plenty of wildlife here, and nature walks and bicycles are on offer, all of which you can book directly at the hotel.
