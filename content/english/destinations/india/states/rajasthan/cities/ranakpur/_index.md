Ranakpur is a little village between Udaipur and Jodhpur, tucked away in the Aravalli hills. You find here an amazing complex of beautifully carved temples, built by the Jains who served the rulers of Udaipur. Built in marble, the main temple has 29 halls supported by over 1,400 pillars, no two of which are alike. The temples open for tourists at noon, and if you are here before 1pm you can enjoy a filling vegetarian lunch.
