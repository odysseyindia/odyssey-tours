This small and unpretentious resort is a good base from which to visit the nearby Ranakpur temples and to take walks in the beautiful countryside.     It is a pleasing low structure built around lawns and carefully planted trees and shrubs. There is a large swimming pool with paved deck space to relax and sunbathe.     The stone floors of the spacious rooms are decorated with small colourful rugs and wide bay windows are filled with mattresses and cushions for relaxing.
