A delightful orchard retreat close to the famous Ranakpur temples. The orchards, surrounded by the Aravalli hills were laid out in the late 19th century by the Maharani of Jodhpur and have always been a favourite holiday resort for the Maharaja's family. There are eighteen well-furnished cottages,  a small swimming pool and an outdoor Rajasthani restaurant.
