Fateh Bagh is a striking building set against the backdrop of the Aravalli hills near Ranakpur. It was created from the ruins of a nearby 200 year old palace, thereby giving new life to some fabulous old stone-work. 65,000 stone parts were carefully transported and meticulously reconstructed into a new delightful building with delicate domes, balconies and carved pillars. The result is an atmospheric boutique hotel which provides a perfect base to explore the nearby Ranakpur temples.
