Khejarla is a small village just off the Jodhpur to Ajmer highway. As you drive along the dusty roads, a truly majestic sight awaits you when you drive through the main entrance to the fort. You arrive in a large garden with many old trees and flowering bougainvillea within rugged walls with sentinel turrets. The carved jharokas (windows) set into the palace fa√ßade are beautiful enough to take your breath away.
