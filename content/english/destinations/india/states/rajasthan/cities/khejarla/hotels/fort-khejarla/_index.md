This impressive fort has recently undergone a total renovation. The rooms now have modern bathrooms but for the rest they retain an old world charm with classic furniture and colourful local fabrics.     Fort Khejarla has white-washed terraces, cool private sit-outs and fabulous views from the upper windows and terraces. You cannot miss the massive granite boulder jutting out of the earth which now borders a stunning marble swimming pool.
