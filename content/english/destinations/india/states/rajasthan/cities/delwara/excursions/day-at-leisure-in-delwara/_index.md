Delwara town has some excellent Jain temples, said to predate the more famous ones at Dilwara near Mount Abu. There is also a large complex of temples at nearby Eklingi which is worth a visit. The holy and interesting town of Nathdwara is also close by. Nathdwara has a temple of Lord Krishna and the famous Pichhwai paintings originate from this place.     he Pichhwai are large banner size paintings which tell stories from the life of Krishna or from the Mahabharata. The main purpose of these paintings was to serve as a backdrop to the deity's statue in a temple. Another use of these paintings was as a story board - whereby bards would use the pictures to tell a story. In the narrow streets of Nathdwara town, you will see several painters busy painting Pichhwais and you can buy them directly from the artists.
