Siana is a small hamlet in south-west Rajasthan with a unique terrain of Aravalli hills bordered by sand dunes and agricultural lands. The run-off from these hills has created picturesque ravines. You can stay here as guests of the local ruler, Pradeep Singh, who organises interesting safaris into outlying areas including Bhil villages and Rabari pastoral settlements, and evening drives to look for leopards.
