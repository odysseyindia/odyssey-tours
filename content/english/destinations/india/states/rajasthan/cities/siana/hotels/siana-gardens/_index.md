Siana Gardens is a small and charming resort in the little visited south-western part of Rajasthan, close to the Gujarat border. There are a number of stone cottages, each with private balconies or sit-outs overlooking the gardens.     Pradeep Singh, a descendent of the old Rajput aristocrat of the area, is a keen wildlife enthuasist and is the best person to take you on a leopard safari.
