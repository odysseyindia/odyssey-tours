Neemrana, two hours' drive south of Delhi, is dominated by the beautiful Neemrana Fort Palace. Built in the 15th century, it was abandoned by its raja in 1947 and slowly fell into ruins. In the 1980s, Neemrana was 'discovered' by Aman Nath and Francis Wacziarg, and they have since restored it, using mainly the local village craftsmen. Today Neemrana Palace is one of the most elegant heritage hotels.
