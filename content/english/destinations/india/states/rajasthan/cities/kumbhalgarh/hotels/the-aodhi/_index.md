The Aodhi, or 'watchtower' is a resort in a peaceful location close to the entrance of the magnificent Kumbhalgarh Fort.     On terraces on the wooded slopes, the stone cottages are built to resemble small fortresses. They are spacious, with rustic wooden furniture, and many have good views over the Aravalli hills. The Aodhi also has a well designed swimming pool. The tented restaurant here serves excellent food.
