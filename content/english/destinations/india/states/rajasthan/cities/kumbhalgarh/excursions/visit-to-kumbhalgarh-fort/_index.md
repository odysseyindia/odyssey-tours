The longest wall in the world after the Great Wall of China, Kumbhalgarh Fort zig-zags down the hill, and is dramatically lit at night for a Sound and Light Show. It is well worth visiting before sunset to wander around this huge structure, before retreating to a distance to take in the spectacle in full as the wall lights are switched off, layer by layer, to leave you with only a starry sky.
