Built high in the hills north of Udaipur, the spectacular 15th-century Kumbhalgarh Fort was called the "eye of Mewar" because of its strategic position in relation to the kingdom's aggressive neighbours. The fort proved impregnable, having withstood numerous attacks. The huge stone bastion of the fort has 33km of walls, in some places over 25 feet thick and enclosing an area of 32 square miles.
