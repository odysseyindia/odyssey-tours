Sardargarh fort is situated 94km north of Udaipur. It was built in the 18th century by the ruling head of an ancient warrior clan and is an exquisite example of Rajput architecture blended with Mughal traditions. The fort overlooks a man-made lake and apparently the Udaipur king was so impressed that he asked the Sardargarh.ruler to Singh to supervise the construction of Jag Niwas, now known as the Lake Palace Hotel.
