Just outside Jaipur, on the Agra highway, this 18th century fortified residence has battlements, stables where horses are kept, and a unique library with a collection of extremely rare books, open to visitors only on request. There are 12 rooms that are appointed with the original furnishings, and the family stays in a separate wing of the castle.
