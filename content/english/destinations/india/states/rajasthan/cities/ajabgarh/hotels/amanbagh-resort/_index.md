Amanbagh, meaning "peaceful garden", lies in a verdant oasis, fed by a nearby lake, and previously the site of the Maharajah of Alwar's hunting lodge and pleasure garden.     Amanbagh is a refined palatial-style mansion, a unique latter day haveli, architecturally faithful to the impressive, imperial Moghul dynasty.
