Daspan is a fascinating town (more a collection of villages) in southwestern Rajasthan. The only accommodation here is at Castle Durjan Niwas, part of which remains the residence of the local landowners, who host their guests personally. This 19th-century building has simple facilities but tremendous atmosphere. Daspanâ€™s friendly inhabitants still create many medieval handicrafts, like pottery, shoe making and silver-work.
