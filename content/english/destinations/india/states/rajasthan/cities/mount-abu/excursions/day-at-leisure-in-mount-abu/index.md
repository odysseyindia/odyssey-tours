The marble cluster of the Dilwara temples has some of the finest carvings in the country and is on par with the Ranakpur temples, predating them by a couple of centuries. For Jains, the temples here are the second holiest after the ones at Palitana.     The Nakki Lake at the centre of town offers boating facilities. In places, the banks of the lake have thick wooded forests. From the lake you can also observe the strange rock, called Toad's rock, because of its distinct resemblance to the amphibian.    Mount Abu also offers delightful walks among its many hilly trails. A longish hike takes you to Trevor Tank, a game sanctuary where you may see small wildlife coming to drink water.
