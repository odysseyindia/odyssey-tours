Mount Abu, at 1,200 metres, is the only hill station in Rajasthan, and its wooded surroundings provide a great contrast to the arid landscape that dominates much of the rest of the state. Many of the Maharajas had summer houses built here. As with most hill stations, Mount Abu surrounds a lovely lake. And just outside the town are the magnificent Dilwara temples, some of the finest examples of Jain architecture in India.
