A charming English country cottage set in shady gardens within walking distance of the town of Mount Abu and the famous Nakki lake. The garden-facing rooms of the old building are simple but comfortable and they are decorated with nice period furniture. The rooms in the new annexe are more modern but they have lovely views over the surrounding hills.
