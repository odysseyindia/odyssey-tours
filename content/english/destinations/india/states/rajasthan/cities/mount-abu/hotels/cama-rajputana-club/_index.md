The Cama Rajputana club is a venerable 135 year old building, built in colonial style. Wide verandahs give shade and peace from where one can admire the hills and the gardens spread over 18 acres on various levels.     The lobby still radiates a colonial atmosphere. There is also a Billiards room, complete with the original 100 year old table. There is a large swimming pool in the gardens and a well equipped gym and Ayurvedic massage centre.
