  - Camel cart ride to Old City Palace
---
It is great fun to ride a camel cart through Karauli's narrow market streets to the Old City Palace. The richly-ornamented 18th-century City Palace has beautiful sandstone cupolas, elaborate stucco-work, spectacular frescoes and an impressive Durbar Hall. The Krishna Temple has a regular, lively prayer ceremony that attracts devotees from surrounding villages. You can also explore the colourful market streets on foot.
