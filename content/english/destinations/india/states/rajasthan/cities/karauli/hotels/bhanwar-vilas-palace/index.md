Staying at Bhanwar Vilas Palace feels like stepping back in time. The impressive early-20th-century building has wide, cool verandahs, authentic period furniture and great ambience, with elaborately-furnished rooms. His Highness, Krishna Chandra Pal, often joins guests at dinner when he is in residence. The extensive hotel grounds also boast an old-fashioned swimming pool, a stable, vintage cars, and an organic garden.
