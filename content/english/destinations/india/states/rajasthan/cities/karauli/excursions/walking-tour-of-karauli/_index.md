The picturesque old fortified town of Karauli was founded in 1348. It became the seat of a small princely state, some of whose rulers played a prominent part in support of the Mughal rulers. From Bhanwar Vilas Palace, a staff member will escort you on a walking tour through the colourful markets to the impressive old City Palace. The richly ornamented 18th-century City Palace has beautiful orange sandstone cupolas, elaborate stucco-work details, spectacular frescoes and an impressive Durbar Hall. The rooftop offers great views over the town and the surrounding hills. The Krishna Temple attached to the palace has a regular lively prayer ceremony that attracts devotes from the surrounding villages.
