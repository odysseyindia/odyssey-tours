A trader from Bagar whose fortune was made in Bombay trading in cotton, opium and other commodities, built the Piramal Haveli in the early 20th century. It is a beautiful mansion with 8 rooms and courtyards enclosed by colonial pillared corridors. Frescoes of flying angels and gods in motor cars adorn the walls in a blend of Rajasthani and European architecture.
