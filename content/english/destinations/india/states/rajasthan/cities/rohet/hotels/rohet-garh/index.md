Still the family home of the erstwhile rulers, it now offers elegantly appointed rooms with frescoes and Rajasthani antiques. The drawing room has ornately carved wooden ceilings, traditional lamps and old photographs. There is a dramatic swimming pool flanked by elegantly carved chhatris. The owners organise excellent safaris by jeep, camel and horse to the surrounding Bishnoi villages.
