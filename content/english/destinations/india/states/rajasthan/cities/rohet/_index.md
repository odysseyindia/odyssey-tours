Rohet is a picturesque hamlet south of Jodhpur, settled by the Bishnoi community. The centre of attraction is a 375-year-old fortified desert home that lies on the banks of a small lake teeming with birdlife. The aristocratic family still reside in the Rohet Garh, restored in the traditional Rajput style. They organise very interesting jeep, camel or horse safaris into the desert and Bishnoi tribal areas.
