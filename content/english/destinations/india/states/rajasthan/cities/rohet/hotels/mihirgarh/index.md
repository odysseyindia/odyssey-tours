This superb, newly-built fortress overlooks the Thar desert, in the heart of Rajasthan. Ranked as one of the best hotels in the world, it mirrors the architecture of the local villages, with rounded edges, open fireplaces and alcoves, and the colour of the stone merges with the surrounding sand. Each luxurious suite provides a unique place to relax, where luxurious appointments act as a foil to the surrounding desert.
