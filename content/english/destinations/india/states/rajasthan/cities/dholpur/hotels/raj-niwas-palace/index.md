The 19th-century Raj Niwas Palace in Dholpur was once home to generations of royals. The red sandstone palace has now been converted to a luxurious heritage hotel with spacious rooms, with decor going from Art Deco to opulently painted walls. Set in 13 acres of garden, the palace grounds are full of peacocks and bird life, and offer a serene base to explore the Chambal river and ravines.
