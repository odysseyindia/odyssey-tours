The Chambal River remains one of north India's most pristine, home to the rare Ganges River dolphins. The other inhabitants include mugger and shy gharial crocodiles, turtles and many species of migratory birds from Siberia. Take a boat safari on the Chambal river, experiencing the magnificent ravines on one side of the bank and wildlife on the expanse of the river on the other.
