85km from Jaipur, in the Shekhawati region of Rajasthan, lies the village of Pachar, with a lake to one side, and sand dunes to the other. Gifted to Thakur Guman Singh by the Maharaja of Jaipur for his support against Bharatpur, Pachar also has an 18th-century fort. The main attraction of the castle is the Rang Mahal, colourfully decorated with family portraits, paintings, arms and comfortable furniture.
