The small village of Khimsar is just off the highway linking Jodhpur and Bikaner. Khimsar is famous for its 15th-century fort, built by the son of Rao Jodha, the founder of Jodhpur. This castle faced many attacks over the centuries and parts were often razed to the ground and rebuilt, resulting in its varied architecture. While the 1920s wing houses the hotel, the 18th-century wing is still home to the present Thakur Saheb.
