Seven terraced gardens command a magnificent view above the restored ramparts at Tijara Fort-Palace. The rooms are spread out over the Rani Mahal (queen's palace) and Mardana Mahal (the males' section), the ramparts, and the cannon chambers. Meals are at the central Kanch Mahal or palace of glass, and there are wonderful sunken structures, like the comfortably shaded swimming pool, and even an underground auditorium.
