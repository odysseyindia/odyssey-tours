Alwar, around 150 km south of Delhi, was formerly the capital of the princely state of Alwar in British India. The  Alwar City Palace, from 1793, blends the Rajputana and Islamic  architectural styles and has marble pavilions on lotus-shaped bases in its courtyard, plus a museum with rare manuscripts. A steep path leads to the Bala Qila fort, approximately 300 meters above the city. Situated on the Aravalli Range, the fort is 5 km long and about 1.5 km wide with turrets, a large gate, a temple, and a residential area.
