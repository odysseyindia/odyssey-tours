Built in phases after it was founded in 1768 by Thakur Nahar Singh, with an imposing entrance, and reached by a flight of stairs, the castle is now run by the seventh descendant of its founder. The fort too has some frescoes, and the large rooms are arched, and well furnished. The old parts of the fort include a well and an ancient tree, while the family lives in its most recent, and modern, addition.
