Mahensar is one of the less visited towns of Shekhavati, perhaps, but definitely one of the most rewarding. Sone Chandi ki Haveli (Mansion of Gold and Silver), which belonged to the Poddar family of jewellers, has the finest frescoes in Shekhavati. The artists are said to have been the descendants of those who painted the spectacular Anup Mahal in Bikaner, and the similarity is evident.
