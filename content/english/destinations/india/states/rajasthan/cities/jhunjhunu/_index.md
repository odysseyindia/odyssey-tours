Jhunjhunu is the most important commercial centre of the Shekhawati district of Rajasthan. Unlike the laid-back feel of the region's smaller towns, Jhunjhunu has lots of traffic and concrete, and the hustle and bustle that befits a district capital. On the other hand, it does have a few appealing havelis (traditional, ornately decorated residences) and a colourful bazaar.
