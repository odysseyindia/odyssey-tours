Pachewar is a small village south of Jaipur, where you will find houses covered with mud-plaster decorated in contrasting white lime-paste designs. You can see the timeless skills of the village craftsmen and watch people going about their daily life just as they have for generations. The focal point of the village is Pachewar Garh, a rambling palace with massive ramparts and a large inner garden, a lovely place to relax.
