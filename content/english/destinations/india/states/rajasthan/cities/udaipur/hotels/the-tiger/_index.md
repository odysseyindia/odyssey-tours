The Tiger is a small but welcoming hotel ideally located amongst the fascinating lanes of the Old City, leading down to Lake Pichola. The rooms are modern, and interestingly   decorated, using quirky "bollywood" themed designs. There are excellent views of the lake, and the Lake Palace hotel, from the rooftop restaurant. There is also a professionally run spa, unusual in such a small hotel.
