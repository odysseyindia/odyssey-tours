A lovely haveli right on the shore of Lake Pichola, in the heart of the romantic city of Udaipur. There are just a handful of rooms but all have lovely cushioned bay windows and balconies overlooking the lake, and there is a small swimming pool in the garden. The waterfront Ambrai restaurant has arguably the best location and views in the entire city.
