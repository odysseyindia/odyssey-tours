In this hands-on cookery class, conducted by Mrs Shastri and her family in their own home, you join a small group of like-minded travellers to learn how to make a variety of Indian dishes. During the three-hour class you will be actively involved in making masala tea, pakoras, various Indian vegetarian curries, pulao rice, and different breads. Finally, you get to enjoy the food which you have prepared, along with the family.
