The main part of the City Palace is now preserved as a museum with a large and varied collection of mosaics, glass and porcelain figures, miniatures and paintings. There are superb views over Lake Pichola and the Lake Palace Hotel from many of the terraces and courtyards within the museum, and an overall air of luxury and grandeur.     Nearby is the Jagdish temple, a centre of constant activity. Dedicated to Lord Vishnu, the temple was built in 1651 by Maharana Jagat Singh I, and is famous for its superb and distinctive architecture.
