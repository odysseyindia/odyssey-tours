A gentle, fun and eco-friendly introduction to City of Lakes. The tour starts with a gentle ride in Jagdish Chowk, the back streets of the Old City. This area and its surroundings are lined with an array of old havelis. From here you head to the bazaar streets selling jewellery, fruits & vegetables, spices, and household items. You then cycle along the banks of Fateh Sagar Lake and then return to Lake Pichola, ending behind the City Palace.
