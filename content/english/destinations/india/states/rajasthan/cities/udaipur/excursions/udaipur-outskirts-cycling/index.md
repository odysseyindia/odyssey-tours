Within just a few minutes' cycling from Lake Fateh Sagar in Udaipur, you are in rural India. Depending on the time of year, you may see local village women collecting water, and might be able to visit a school and a local house. Snacks and mineral water are provided. The roads have little traffic, though there are some small hills, particularly around the scenic Tiger Lake, but the modern hybrid cycles have plenty of gears! You return to Udaipur having experienced aspects of the cityâ€™s immediate surroundings that are unknown to most visitors.
