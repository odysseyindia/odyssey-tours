An old haveli with beautiful views over the lake and the city palace. Most of the rooms offer good views and few even have a small balcony attached. There are pleasant sitouts and lounges, including a verandah restaurant and a rooftop lounge with deck-chairs to soak in the sun with views of the lake.
