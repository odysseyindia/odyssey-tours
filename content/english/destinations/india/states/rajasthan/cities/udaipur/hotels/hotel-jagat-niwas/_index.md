A delightful 17th century haveli right on the banks of the Lake Pichola, entered down a narrow alley off the city's bazaar roads. The hotel has 30 rooms, quite different in decor but all attractively furnished. Many offer stunning views of the lake. The restaurant too has great views of the Lake Palace.
