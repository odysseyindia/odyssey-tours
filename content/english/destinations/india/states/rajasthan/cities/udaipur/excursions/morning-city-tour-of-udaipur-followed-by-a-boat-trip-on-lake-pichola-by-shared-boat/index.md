    Morning city tour of Udaipur followed by a boat trip on Lake Pichola (by
    shared boat)
---
The highlight of this guided city tour is a visit to the City Palace, now largely preserved as a museum with a large and varied collection of mosaics, glass and porcelain figures, miniatures and paintings. There are superb views over Lake Pichola and the Lake Palace Hotel. Nearby is the 17th-century Jagdish temple, famous for its superb and distinctive architecture and a centre of constant activity.     

The city tour is followed by a relaxing, hour-long (shared) motor boat ride on the lake, with views of the activity on the "ghats" used by local people for washing and bathing, the City Palace complex, and the Aravalli Hills to the west. You also pass the famous luxury Lake Palace hotel, and stop to visit the serene "pleasure island" of Jag Mandir.
