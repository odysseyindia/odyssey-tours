The Neem Tree is a new, eco-conscious boutique retreat, a short walk through the bustling bazaar from the City Palace and Pichola Lake. Local craftsmen have created the ornate exterior, and the unique bedrooms feature beautifully carved stone windows and hand-carved furniture. There is a tranquil courtyard with a magnificent neem tree and turquoise swimming pool, and a spectacular view of the City Palace.
