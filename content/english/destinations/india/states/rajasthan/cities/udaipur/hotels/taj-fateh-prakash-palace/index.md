Among the heritage hotels, the highest category is Grand Heritage - denoting an especially opulent palace. Fateh Prakash is justifiably in this category. Now managed by the Taj group, the hotel consists of a handful of rooms that are part of the City Palace and a new wing of excellent rooms by the lake. Most rooms enjoy fabulous views over Lake Pichola and the Lake Palace, and feature authentic period furniture.
