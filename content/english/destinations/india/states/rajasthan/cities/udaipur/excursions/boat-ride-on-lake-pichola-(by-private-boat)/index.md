---
Lake Pichola, the scenic focus of Udaipur, is surrounded by hills, gardens, havelis, ghats and temples. Set in it are two island palaces, Jag Niwas and Jag Mandir. The former was a summer residence of the princes of Mewar and is the luxury Lake Palace hotel. Jag Mandir is built of yellow sandstone inlaid in marble around an attractive courtyard. It is notable for the Gul Mahal, a domed pavilion. You can take a very pleasant one-hour private trip by boat around the lake, including a visit to Jag Mandir island.
