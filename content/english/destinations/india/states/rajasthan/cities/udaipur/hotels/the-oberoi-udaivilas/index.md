If you are going to visit Udaipur, and really want to indulge, stay at the newly-built Oberoi Udaivilas. Built on the edge of Lake Pichola with a sublime view of the Lake Palace and City Palace, this is one of the most luxurious hotels in India. The rooms with semi-private pool are spectacular. There is a luxurious spa, a pool, peacocks roaming the grounds, and an ambiance that will transport you back to the era of the maharajas.
