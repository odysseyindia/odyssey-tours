A pleasant old haveli built around a courtyard. The courtyard is filled with a beautiful garden with many fine palms adding their charm. There are 20 well-appointed rooms with high ceilings and furnished with period furniture, a small swimming pool, library, games rooms, table tennis and pool table. It is a place with great character, but unfortunately no lake views.
