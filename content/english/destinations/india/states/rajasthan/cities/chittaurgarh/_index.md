The colossal hilltop fort of Chittaurgarh was the ancient capital of Mewar state. Thrice in its long history, Chittaurgarh was sacked by a stronger enemy, and on each occasion the men rode out to certain death, while the women committed johar by throwing themselves and their children onto a huge funeral pyre. The immense stretch of Chittaurgarh's walls and ruined palaces relate the saga of innumerable sieges and heroism.
