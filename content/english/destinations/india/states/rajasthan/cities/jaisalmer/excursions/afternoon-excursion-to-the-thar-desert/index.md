  - Afternoon excursion to the Thar desert

Leaving Jaisalmer in mid-afternoon, you enjoy a half-hour jeep ride, and then board camels for a ride lasting approximately two hours through a peaceful and unspoilt part of the Thar Desert. You pass through surprisingly well-populated scrubland to end the ride at some small sand dunes where you can enjoy the sunset, before returning to Jaisalmer by jeep in time for dinner.
