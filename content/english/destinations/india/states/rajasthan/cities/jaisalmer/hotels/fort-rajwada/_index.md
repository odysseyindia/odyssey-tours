An upmarket option in Jaisalmer, Fort Rajwada is situated 2 km out of town but offers splendid views of the Fort. An impressive stone arch welcomes you to the large grounds of the hotel. The interiors are luxuriously cool with central air-conditioning and an abundance of marble. There are two restaurants, an attractive bar, and a large swimming pool. The hotel also has a billiards room, a health club, gymnasium and spa.
