The massive, turreted Golden Fort dominates Jaisalmer's skyline and the vast surrounding desert. Founded in the 12th century, the fort stands on a high hill, enclosed by a thick wall and reinforced with bastions. Within these bastions is a complete township of cobbled streets strewn with palaces, mansions of rich merchants, and temples. Walking through the narrow lanes provides visitors with an extraordinarily medieval feel, unique in modern India.
