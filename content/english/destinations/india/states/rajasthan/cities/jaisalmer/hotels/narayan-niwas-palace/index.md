The only large heritage hotel within Jaisalmer's fort. Once upon a time, Jaisalmer's top hotel, the Narayan Niwas is now over-shadowed by newer, more luxurious hotels. The 43 a/c rooms are on the small side but adequately furnished. There is a dark, indoor swimming pool, a bar and a restaurant. The views of the Fort from the rooftop are probably the best in town.
