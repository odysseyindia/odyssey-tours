An attractive sandstone building, of traditional Jaisalmer architecture, just 1km to the south of Jaisalmer's fort, this is a simple but relaxing place. The rooms are pleasantly decorated using bright colours, and the rooftop restaurant is great place to unwind while enjoying the spectacular views of the Fort.
