A luxury desert camp and spa, The Serai has 21, large canvas tents set on in the Great Thar Desert near the ancient city of Jaisalmer.    The camp has a pool inspired by a traditional Indian step-well, a world class Spa, a Dining Tent and Lounge Bar.    Being only 30 km away from Jaisalmer, it is an excellent base from which to explore the city, but also far enough from anywhere to really relax and unwind.
