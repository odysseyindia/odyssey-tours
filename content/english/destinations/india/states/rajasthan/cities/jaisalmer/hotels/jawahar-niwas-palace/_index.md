Jaisalmer's finest heritage hotel. Formerly the Maharaja of Jaisalmer's residence, the Jawahar Niwas Palace has recently been completely renovated  The rooms are spacious with a high ceiling and are superbly furnished. The roof-top gives fabulous views over the Jaisalmer fort and the surrounding areas stretching towards the desert, particularly at sunset time. There is a circular pool with ample lounging space - welcome in the high temperatures and the dry climate.
