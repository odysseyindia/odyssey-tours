Just opposite the royal cenotaphs, this hotel is about one km outside town, but it offers one of the best views of the Jaisalmer fort, especially at sunset.     The small, circular burj (tower) rooms are charming, with marble beds and lights concealed in the nooks of the stone walls. The hotel also has a restaurant, a bar and a large swimming pool.
