A massive fort-like entrance distinguishes this hotel from the others in the neighbourhood. Set on a slight slope, the Rang Mahal is indeed an impressive building. The fifty rooms are well furnished with cheerful bright colours. There is a restaurant and a good sized swimming pool. The hotel is situated on Sam Road, a few km from the city.
