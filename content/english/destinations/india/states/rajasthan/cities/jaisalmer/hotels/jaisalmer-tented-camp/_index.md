The best way to experience the Thar Desert that surrounds Jaisalmer is on an overnight camel safari. Leaving Jaisalmer in the mid-afternoon, you enjoy a half-hour jeep ride, and then board camels for a ride lasting approximately 2 hours through a peaceful, unspoilt area of the desert, passing through a mix of scrub, bushes, and sand dunes.   The camp is set up in a peaceful location close to sand dunes. The tents are simple, but all bedding is supplied, and hot water is provided for washing. The camp staff prepares dinner and breakfast, and the highlight is spending the evening under a blanket of stars. The next morning, there is a second camel ride on a different route for around an hour before rejoining the jeep for the drive back to Jaisalmer, arriving in the mid-morning.
