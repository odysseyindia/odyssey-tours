A modern hotel but yet with a medieval charm. Rawal-Kot is situated a few kilometres out of town but with good views of Jaisalmer fort. Built from the local yellow sandstone in the old haveli style, the 31 rooms get ample natural light and are tastefully furnished with local materials, colours and designs.
