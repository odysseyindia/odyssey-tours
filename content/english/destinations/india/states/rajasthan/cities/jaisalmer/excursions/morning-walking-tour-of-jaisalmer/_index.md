Jaisalmer, with its narrow cobbled lanes, is a wonderful place to wander around on foot. The fort itself is not simply a monument, but is home to several thousand people. Within it you can see attractive Jain temples and fascinating architecture, and enjoy superb views over the city and the desert from many vantage points. Hidden among the narrow lanes leading off the main market street are several magnificent havelis. Patwon Ki Haveli is best known for its latticed facade, and Nathmal Haveli has now been converted into a small museum of local artefacts. The Gadi Sagar lake is also worth seeing for its historic pavilions.
