Newly constructed, but built to resemble a proper Jaisalmer palace down to the golden-yellow sandstone, Suryagarh is a very luxurious option outside the main city. There is a variety of rooms and suites, eclectically decorated, and plenty of courtyards, restaurants and nooks in which to relax, along with a large swimming pool.
