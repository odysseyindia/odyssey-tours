This extensive 19th-century royal palace is constructed in yellow sandstone, with delightful stone carvings. Mandir Palace has been extensively renovated, and is now a comfortable heritage hotel with modern rooms, a pleasant swimming pool, and a fabulous location close to the Old City of Jaisalmer. There is also a museum, demonstrating how the property has been an important part of Jaisalmer's history.
