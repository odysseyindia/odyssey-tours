A 300-year-old sandstone mansion in the old part of Jaisalmer, Nachana Haveli has a lovely secluded courtyard with narrow corridors leading to rooms scattered throughout the building. The rooms vary in size but they are all full of character, furnished with lovely carved furniture and old paintings and relics. The rooftop Saffron restaurant has fine views of Jaisalmer Fort and is a popular gathering place in the evenings.
