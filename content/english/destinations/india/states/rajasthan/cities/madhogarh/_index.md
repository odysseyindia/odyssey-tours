Madhogarh is a typical small Rajasthani town, dominated by the picturesque Madhogarh Fort, situated on an elephant-back-shaped hill. From the ramparts you have breathtaking views of the surrounding countryside. The Raja and his wife are excellent hosts and can organise village walks or trips into the countryside. Even today communities of potters, carpenters, cobblers, carpet makers etc. ply their trade in centuries-old ways.
