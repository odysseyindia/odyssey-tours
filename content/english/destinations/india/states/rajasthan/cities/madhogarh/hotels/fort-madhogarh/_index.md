Fort Madhogarh is fabulously situated atop a lone hill in the plains.   From the rampart walls you can have breathtaking views of the surrounding countryside.     Madhogarh is a typical small Rajasthani town, even today communities of potters, carpenters, cobblers, carpet makers etc. can be seen plying their trade in the centuries old traditional way.     You'll have the opportunity to explore the nearby village to get an insight into rural India.
