Head out for an invigorating drive into the countryside and experience the breath-taking view of the salt pans under the desert sun. The site is also the habitat for several migratory birds and an ideal spot for birding. The drive also offers a glimpse into the Rabari settlements. The safari is also an ideal picnic spot with tea & snacks served at the site at sunset.
