Chanoud is almost mid-way Jodhpur and Udaipur. This off the beaten track village houses a 300-year â€“old fort, now converted into a small luxury heritage hotel. The  13th-generation royal descendent s who host your stay arrange the most authentic encounters with local villagers and  excursions to the bird-rich saltpans in the nearby Aravalli foothills.
