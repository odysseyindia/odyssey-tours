Every morning, after breakfast, a retired local schoolteacher takes guests on a hugely enjoyable village walk. You will visit the local temple, see a step-well, and will witness local tradesmen, such as cobblers and tailors, at work. As you stroll around, the friendly local villagers will be happy to be photographed and to exchange a few words of greeting.
