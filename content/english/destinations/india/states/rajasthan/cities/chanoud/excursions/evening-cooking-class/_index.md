This fun cooking class, led by the lady of the house, guides you through a 4-5 course Rajasthani menu, including dessert. Conducted in a separate kitchen/dining area, the 2-3 hour class is interactive, and takes you through the whole cooking process. Tea and drinks are served during the class, and you get to enjoy the dinner afterwards. You will also be given prints of the family recipes, and small souvenirs.
