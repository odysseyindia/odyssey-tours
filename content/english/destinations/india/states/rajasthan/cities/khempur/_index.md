An hour's drive east of Udaipur is the little village of Khempur, set amid mustard and millet fields. At the edge of the village is Ravla Khempur, now a heritage hotel, famous in film as the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel. A large neem tree shades the family temple next to the fort. Khempur is famous for its beautiful Marwari horses. A stay here therefore offers the opportunity to explore the Indian countryside on horseback.
