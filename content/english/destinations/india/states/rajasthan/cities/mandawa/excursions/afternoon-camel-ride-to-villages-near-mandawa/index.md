  - Afternoon camel ride to villages near Mandawa
---
An afternoon camel ride to nearby villages is a good way to get to know the Shekhavati desert. It is a short but scenic ride and the local people are genuinely pleased to see you. It is surprising how well populated the desert is, and there is an ever changing panorama of farmland, wells, and villages to be seen amongst the desert scrub from your lofty perch on the camel.
