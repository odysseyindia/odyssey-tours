Mandawa Haveli is a late 19th century building converted into a heritage hotel. A majestic entrance leads to an inner courtyard decorated with fresco paintings portraying legends of Lord Krishna's life.     The rooms branch off from the inner courtyard. They vary in size and shape as they had to be accommodated within the old structure. However, the bathrooms are modern and functional. Candlelit dinners in the rooftop restaurant provide a chance to enjoy Rajasthani food in the magical ambience of this frescoed building.
