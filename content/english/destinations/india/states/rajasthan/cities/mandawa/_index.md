Mandawa is a small town situated in the heart of Rajasthan's Shekhavati area, famous for its painted havelis (mansions). They were built in the 19th century by Marwari merchants who were patrons of the arts. These havelis, lavishly decorated with frescoes, became the symbol of the status of the Marwaris and homes for their extended families, providing security and comfort in style.
