Starting at the impressive Mandawa Castle, our guide takes you on a stroll around the sandy lanes of this small town. Here you will see several of the "painted havelis" for which the region of Shekhawati is renowned. Built by wealthy Marwari merchants, some of these large family houses are now semi-abandoned, others slowly being restored. The paintings depict not only religious scenes, but also many different aspects of daily life, including several which display the influence of Europeans. Often referred to as an "open-air art gallery", the havelis, and other typical architectural features such as wells and memorials, are unique to this area.
