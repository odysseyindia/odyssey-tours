In the quiet village of Churi Ajitgarh, just 10 kilometers from Mandawa, two adjoining traditional havelis now offer the most stylish accommodation in the Shekawati region.      The original exteriors of the 19th century havelis has been retained, along with their fresco paintings, but the interiors have been furnished in a very modern, contemporary style, with excellent use of light and space, allowing for an indulgent stay in comfort, in historic surroundings.
