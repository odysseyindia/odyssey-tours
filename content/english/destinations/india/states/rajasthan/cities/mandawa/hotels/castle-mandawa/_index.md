Castle Mandawa is literally a castle in the centre of Mandawa, a maze of terraces, courtyards, narrow staircases and other intriguing elements. Sword-bearing guards welcome you at the gate; inside, the walls display 16th-century portraits of the Mandawa family and lovely frescoes. The rooms have period furniture, murals and alcoved sitting areas, and the fabrics are in bold colours. The dinners in the central courtyards or garden are dramatic, with dancers with lit torches.
