Nagaur lies midway between Jodhpur and Bikaner. The historic fort at Nagaur encompasses a beautifully painted palace. The old city harbours several mosques, one of which was commissioned by Emperor Akbar. The Nagaur cattle fair is a major cultural event of the region and it draws a large number of local people who come to trade and celebrate at this important fair.
