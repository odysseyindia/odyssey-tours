A magnificent fort atop a sheer, 1,000-foot rock cliff, Kuchaman Fort is now a heritage hotel. A jeep takes you up the incredibly steep road to the massive portals. Inside, you can see the original inlay work in semi-precious stones, glass and gold paint. You can see millions of reflections of yourself in the Sheesh Mahal (glass palace), covered in glass and gold inlay. The colourful bazaar below the fort is worth visiting.
