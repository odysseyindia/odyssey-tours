Though Shahpura Bagh is perfect for total indolence, it also offers a number of activities, like visits to the nearby village and market. To understand the local culture, Sit with the Joshis (priests) and watch a traditional phad, a painting depicting mythology and history, come to life. You can also go on jeep or cycle safaris, a bullock cart ride with an outdoor breakfast, visit a school, or have a sundowner at the family's private fort. You can book all of these directly at the hotel.
