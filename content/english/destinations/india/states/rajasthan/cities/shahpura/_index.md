Shahpura is a small town in central Rajasthan. It houses Shahpura Bagh, a 120-year-old estate, set in 45 acres of garden and pasture and surrounded by lakes, and now a wonderful boutique hotel. There is an interesting step-well just outside the Bagh walls and a temple with some excellent marble carvings, surrounded by a colourful market.
