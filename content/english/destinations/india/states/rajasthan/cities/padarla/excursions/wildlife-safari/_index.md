A naturalist will be your guide for a leopard safari in the Jawai Conservation Zone. Leopards are solitary, elusive creatures, but this rocky landscape is the perfect place to look for them. The safari (with up to 5 people to a jeep) includes a high-tea break and plenty of time to look for the cats.
