Set amidst the Aravalli Hills, the village of Jojawar houses the 18th-century Rawla Jojawar, now converted into a heritage hotel, and superbly managed by members of the former ruling family. Jeep safaris are organized by the family to the neighboring tribal settlements. Also not to be missed is a short train safari that takes you through the picturesque Aravali hills.
