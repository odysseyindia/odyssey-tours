This is a wonderful hotel in rural surroundings managed by a very hospitable family. Part of the 18th-century fort has been restored to create comfortable rooms. The facade mirrors the style of the original fort, with scalloped arches and delicate latticework. In the courtyard garden is a delightful Rajasthani pavilion tent. Afternoon tea can be enjoyed here, overlooking the garden, with a glimpse of the swimming pool.
