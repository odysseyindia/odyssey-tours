Set in forested country, Bassi lay on the route of Mughal and Maratha invasions, and wears the scars of its history. Besides a shooting lodge, it has step wells, cenotaphs, temples, and the Bassi Wildlife Sanctuary to offer as attractions. The sculpture and woodcraft of Bassi are very famous, as are its blood-soaked stories of loyalty and terrible sacrifice.
