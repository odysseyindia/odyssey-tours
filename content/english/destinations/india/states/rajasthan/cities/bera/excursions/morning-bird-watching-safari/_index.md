A highlight of any trip to the Bera region is a visit to the nearby Jawai Dam, the biggest dam in western Rajasthan and a paradise for migratory and residential birds like the Sarus Crane, Indian Courser, Osprey, Pelicans, Bar- Headed Geese, Water fowl, pipits, larks, pratincoles, and other raptors to mention just a few.  With over a hundred bird species to see and photograph, a visit to Jawai is incredibly rewarding.
