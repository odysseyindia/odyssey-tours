A region of dramatic rocky outcrops and small lakes, bordered by the Aravalli Hills to the east, this land is home to the Rabari shepherds, and is a major bastion of the Indian leopard. Midway between Jodhpur and Udaipur, it's a great base for getting to know rural India, and for wonderful wildlife spotting, from leopards to a vast array of migratory birds, as well as crocodiles and turtles.
