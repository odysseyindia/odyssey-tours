Run by a conservationist who saved the area from being given over to mining, Bera Safari Lodge is a collection of comfortable low-rise cottages, made from the handsome local stone. The lodge's main focus is leopards, which you can look for on jeep safaris into the Jawai Leopard Conservation Area, but you can also visit the Rabari shepherd villages, the Jawai dam (excellent for birding), and wander around on bicycles or on foot.
