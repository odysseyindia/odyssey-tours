  - Jeep safari to villages surrounding Chandelao
---
On a village safari by jeep you will see the local craftsmen at work, and will visit a Bishnoi family in their traditional home. In winter there are many migratory birds, and deer and peacocks can be seen, as well as blackbuck and nilgai. You will see local women in traditional attire fetching water from the wells, and gain an insight into traditional Indian village life â€“ and take part in a traditional opium ceremony!
