Just an hour's drive away from Jodhpur is the small village of Chandelao with its 300-year-old fort. Here you can interact with the local community and learn about the art, culture and heritage of Rajasthan, and this is one of the best places to witness traditional village life - an unforgettable experience that invariably proves to be a highlight of a visit to India.
