  - Excursion to Pipar bazaar
---
Only twenty kilometres from Chandelao are the bazaars of Pipar, medieval-era markets selling unique local crafts and ethnic goods. Pipar is little visited by travellers from overseas, so you will see the local people going about their daily activities as they have for many years. In Pipar, you can also visit the block printers who use hand-carved wooden printing blocks to produce beautiful, colourful designs on cloth.
