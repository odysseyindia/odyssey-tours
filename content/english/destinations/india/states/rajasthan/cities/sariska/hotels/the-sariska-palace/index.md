A former royal hunting lodge now converted into a palace hotel. The impressive 19th century Art Deco building is set at the end of a large circular driveway. There are more than a hundred rooms spread over the main old building as well as in modern bungalows set in the large grounds. The palace offers a swimming pool and a health club with Ayurvedic therapies. Jeep safaries into the park can be booked directly through the hotel.
