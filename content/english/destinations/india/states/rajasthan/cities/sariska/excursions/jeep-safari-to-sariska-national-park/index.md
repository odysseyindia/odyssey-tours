  - Jeep safari to Sariska National Park
---
The heavily-forested Sariska reserve is a natural habitat for the tiger. On a jeep safari through the park, you are likely to see a large number of deer species and langurs. Other residents of the reserve are the leopard, jungle cat, jackal, hyena, and wild dog. Like all parks, there is also a large variety of bird life in Sariska. The jeep safari takes place either in the early morning or in the late afternoon.
