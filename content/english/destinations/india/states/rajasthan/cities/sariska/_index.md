Once the hunting ground of the Maharaja of Alwar, Sariska National Park is a surprisingly lush wooded valley in the midst of a largely dry area. In its 800 sq km core area, the park protects much wildlife such as a small number of tigers, various deers, monkeys, peacocks and birds. The park also contains some ancient ruins of Shiva temples and the Kanokwari fort. The park is open all year round.
