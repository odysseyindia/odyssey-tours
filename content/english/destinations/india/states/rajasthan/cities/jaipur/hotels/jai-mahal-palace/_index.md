A lovely sprawling palace in 18 acres of gardens. Once the residence of the prime minister of Royal Jaipur, the Taj Group of Hotels renovated the palace building retaining the original architecture.     The Jai Mahal is now a gracious luxury hotel with 100 rooms, several restaurants, a bar, solar heated swimming pool, jogging track, table tennis and astrologer.
