The City Palace, the principal residence of the former royal family, also houses a museum for textiles and costumes, miniatures, carpets and manuscripts, and arms and armour. Nearby is the Jantar Mantar, a stone observatory created by an astronomer-king in the 18th century to measure everything from altitude to time, and to map the movement of the planets and the stars.    The 'Palace of the Winds', or Hawa Mahal, is the pink sandstone facade of a palace with a profusion of windows and stone screens. The windows enabled cool air (hawa) to circulate and the women of the royal zenana would sit concealed behind these screens to see life in the city beyond the walls of the city palace.    Situated just to the north of Jaipur, Amber Fort overlooks the city from a spur of the Aravali Hills. From the parking area below the Fort, you take the short walk up the steep path to the entrance courtyard, which leads to a magnificent complex of palaces, halls, pavilions, gardens and temples built over a period of 125 years by successive rulers.
