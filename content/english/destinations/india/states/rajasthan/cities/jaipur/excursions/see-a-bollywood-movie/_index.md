Raj Mandir Cinema is one of India's largest and most famous movie theaters. Built in the art-deco style, and painted pink as per local tradition, the meringue-shaped auditorium opened in 1976, and invariably shows the latest Hindi blockbuster. It's usually full, despite its immense size, but bookings can be made in advance by our Jaipur representative. There are no subtitles, but it is usually possible to follow the broad outline of the plot, as Hindi movies are not known for their subtlety, and the enthusiastic reactions of the local audience also provide a reflection of what is happening on screen.
