A pleasant moderate haveli situated within walking distance to the Old City of Jaipur. Built in traditional Rajput style with large courtyard in front, corridors with arched pillards, stained glass, and gardens, the early 20th century building has an 'aristocratic' feel. The rooms have cool marble floors and are fairly good sized and comfortably furnished.
