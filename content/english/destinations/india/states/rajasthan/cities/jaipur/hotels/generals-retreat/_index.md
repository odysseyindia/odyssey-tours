Just outside the Old City, but walking distance from Anokhi, the popular textile store with a lovely caf√©, is the General's Retreat, the home of a distinguished family who accommodate guests in 12 simple but comfortable rooms above their residence. The large lawn insulates the property from the hustle and bustle of the city, making this a peaceful and relaxing place to stay.
