Just to the north of Jaipur, Amber Fort overlooks the city from a spur of the Aravali Hills. There is a short, steep walk up to the entrance courtyard, which leads to a magnificent complex of palaces, halls, pavilions, gardens and temples built over 125 years. There are excellent views down over the old town of Amer, and up to the Jaigarh and Nahargarh Forts higher in the hills.
