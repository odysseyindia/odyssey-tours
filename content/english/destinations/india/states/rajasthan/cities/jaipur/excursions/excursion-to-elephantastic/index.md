This is a fabulous fully inclusive and immersive "elephant experience", situated close to Amber Fort. More than 20 elephants are looked after and cared for here, and on arrival you will immediately be introduced to the elephant who will be "yours" for the afternoon. You will first get to know the elephant, so that you feel comfortable with each other. You will feed the elephant and learn some of the instructions to which they respond. Later you can "paint" your elephant with vegetable dyes. You will then wash and bathe your elephant - do carry a change of clothes as you will get wet!     Finally, you ride your elephant along the sandy paths surrounding their home. Also included is a simple but tasty home cooked lunch served at the home of the founder of Elephantastic, and soft drinks and mineral water are provided throughout. This is a fun, unique and memorable way to get close to, and learn about, elephants in a safe and secure environment where they are well treated - responsible travel at its best!
