Devraj Niwas is a surprising new boutique hotel in the heart of Jaipur. Even though this is a heritage building, it has been renovated in a modern, contemporary style. There are 21 tastefully crafted rooms, all on ground floor, and all open out into a wonderful lush tropical garden.    Devraj Niwas also features a fine dining restaurant - The Forresta - which serves a selection of contemporary cuisine from round the world.
