A garden retreat of the royal family of Kanota now converted into a heritage hotel. Run by the family, the hotel has 37 airconditioned and air-cooled rooms including 11 suites. The mod-cons inside are a mix of royal portraiture, opulent chandeliers, painted walls, religious images, ornate fireplaces, and hybrid colonial furniture. There is a large swimming pool surrounded by big shaded trees.
