This distinctive, stylish small heritage property has 10 rooms, all suites, with a meticulous eye for detail. The owner Durga Singh and his family look after all guests as they would visitors to their home, and offer lots of suggestions for your time in Jaipur. The suites are all individually designed and furnished, and some have mezzanine floors. Delicious local food is served in the dining room, or in the pretty courtyard.
