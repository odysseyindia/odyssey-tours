Loharu House is an atmospheric heritage property, situated within its own extensive grounds. The sixteen spacious rooms have beautiful antique furniture whilst the large dining and living rooms are filled with hunting trophies, evoking the atmosphere of a bygone era.     But, despite the grand appearance, the Loharu House retains an intimate feel, being personally run by the descendents of the original owners.
