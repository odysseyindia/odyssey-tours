---
In the early morning, you embark on a unique journey by bicycle into the streets of the old city. You experience the true Jaipur as you cycle through the narrow alleys to get a peek into the homes, kitchens and workshops. You get to learn about the lives of the locals, and the history of the city, as well as visit the colourful and bustling vegetable and flower markets. You also enjoy a traditional Rajasthani breakfast in a local house.
