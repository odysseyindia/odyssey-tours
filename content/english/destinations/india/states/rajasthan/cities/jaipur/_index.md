Jaipur is one of the most interesting cities in India, with exuberant 18th- and 19th-century palaces and exotic street life. Just outside town is the impressive Amber Fort. It is worthwhile spending time wandering through the bazaars. Jaipur is well known for its beautiful carpets, enameled ornaments, precious and semi-precious stones, brass ornaments and many other arts and crafts.
