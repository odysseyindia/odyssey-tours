A grand haveli dating back to 1728 has been converted into a swanky superior hotel. Located just outside the gates of the walled city, the building has been extensively renovated.     Floors are made of intricately laid contrasting marble patterns. Rooms are spacious and  appointed with furniture and fabrics chosen to impart the old feel. There is a restaurant and a bar.
