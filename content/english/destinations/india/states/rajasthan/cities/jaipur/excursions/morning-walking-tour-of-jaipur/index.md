To experience the life of the Pink City beyond the monuments, it is best to join a guided morning walk. Starting in the heart of the Old City, you will walk along the busy main streets, lined with parades of traditional shops, and explore smaller side streets, each devoted to different crafts. You will see various tradesmen, such as marble-sculptors and bangle-makers at work, visit local temples, see the colourful vegetable and flower markets, and sample delicious street foods, such as jalebis, rabri, kachoris, and lassi.
