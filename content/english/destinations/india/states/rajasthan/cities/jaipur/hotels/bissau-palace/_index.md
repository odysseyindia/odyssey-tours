Built by the rawals of Bissau in Shekavati as a handsome town house, it still retains its collection of armoury, portraits, library and furniture, and is in very easy reach of the old city.  Set in a garden, the rambling building has a quaint colonial air about it. It has 36 rooms and a restaurant, as well as a charming lounge.
