You join local resident Payal, a keen cook and food blogger, who will share with you the secrets of her home cooking. She will take you to the food markets of Jaipur to purchase the ingredients for the dishes you will cook together. She will explain the preparation of traditional Rajasthani food, and the use of various spices. Once you have helped prepare the dishes, you get to enjoy them as lunch or dinner. With easy-to-follow menus, and after your completely hands-on experience, you will be eager to demonstrate your new skills back home!
