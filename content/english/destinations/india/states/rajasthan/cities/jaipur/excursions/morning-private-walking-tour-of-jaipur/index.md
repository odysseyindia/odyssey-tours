  - Morning private walking tour of Jaipur
---
To experience the life of the Pink City of Jaipur beyond the monuments, it is best to take a private, guided morning walk. Starting in the heart of the Old City you will walk along the busy main streets, lined with parades of traditional shops, and also explore the smaller side streets, each devoted to different crafts. You will see various tradesmen, such as marble sculptors and bangle makers at work, visit local temples, see the colourful vegetable and flower markets, and sample delicious street foods, such as jalebis, rabri, kachoris, and lassi.
