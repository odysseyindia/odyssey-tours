The City Palace, the principal residence of the former royal family, also houses a museum for textiles and costumes, miniatures, carpets and manuscripts, and arms and armour. Nearby is the Jantar Mantar, a stone observatory created by an astronomer-king in the 18th century to measure everything from altitude to time, and map the movement of the planets and the stars.    
 
The *Palace of the Winds*, or Hawa Mahal, is the pink sandstone facade of a palace with a profusion of windows and stone screens. The windows enabled cool air (hawa) to circulate and the women of the royal zenana would sit concealed behind these screens to see life in the city beyond the walls of the city palace.
