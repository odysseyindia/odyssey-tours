A lovely old haveli set around a pleasant courtyard, just inside the Old City walls, built as a townhouse for the royal family of Samode. The rooms in the rambling building are well furnished with local hand-block printed fabrics and period furniture. The restaurant is decorated with exquisite frescoes. The pool area, with a bar and spa, is a very welcome area for relaxation. A genteel, luxurious option in Jaipur.
