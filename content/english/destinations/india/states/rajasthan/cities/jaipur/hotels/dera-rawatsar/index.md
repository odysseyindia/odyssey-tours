Dera Rawatsar is a family-run boutique hotel, warm as a home. Located just behind the bus station, Dera Rawatsar lies in a quiet, leafy lane. Within its walls are small courtyards and terraces, lawns and secluded corners. The well-decorated and traditionally-furnished rooms are all different. Meals, drinks and snacks are served in the family's dining room or the outdoor courtyard. There is also a small swimming pool.
