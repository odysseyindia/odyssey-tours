A majestic fort now converted into an immaculate heritage resort, the Karni Fort has architectural elements that have been aesthetically replicated. The original fortifications and turrets have been left virtually untouched. The interiors invoke a feeling of medieval opulence with interesting mirror work and gilded furniture.The resort also has a spectacular swimming pool.
