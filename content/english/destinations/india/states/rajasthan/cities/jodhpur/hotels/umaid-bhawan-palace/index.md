A splendid example of the Indo-colonial and art-deco style of the 1930s. It took 25 years and 3,000 men to build this, the largest and grandest private residence in the world. It is now a fabulous luxury hotel with 98 air-conditioned rooms and suites, a swimming pool, health club and facilities for tennis, billiards, horse riding and golf. It has a special multi-cuisine restaurant and trophy bar.
