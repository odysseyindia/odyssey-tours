A unique hotel in the heart of the old city of Jodhpur, with superb views over the city. Located close to the bottom of the majestic Meherangarh Fort, Pal Haveli is possibly the best place from which to admire the scope of this architectural feat.The haveli is a maze of courtyards, stone stairways, terraces and excellent carvings. The spacious guest rooms are delightfully furnished in the typical Rajasthani aristocratic style.
