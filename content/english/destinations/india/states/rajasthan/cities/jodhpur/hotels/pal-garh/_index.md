Though Pal is now almost a suburb of Jodhpur, the area immediately around Pal Garh has the feel of a rural village. The large well appointed rooms surround a delightful garden. There is a swimming pool, and an overall atmosphere of peace and tranquility, yet the bustling city of Jodhpur is just a few minutes away, making this an ideal base for those looking for comfort and relaxation after sightseeing.
