Ratan Vilas is a charming family-run heritage hotel. A formal, circular drive leads you to the handsome sandstone building, built in 1920. With a pleasant front lawn and a lovely pool area, this is a calm oasis away from the old city. The large verandah leads to a nice and airy courtyard from where you access the guest rooms. All the rooms are spotlessly clean and tastefully decorated with antiques and block-print fabrics.
