Standing at the edge of the Thar desert, Jodhpur is dominated by the massive Meherangarh Fort. The fort houses an excellent museum and affords captivating views of the blue Brahmin houses of the old city. The clock tower is a popular landmark in the old city. Narrow alleys lead from here to bazaars for textiles, silver and handicrafts. It's a fascinating jumble of winding streets, of great interest to wander around.
