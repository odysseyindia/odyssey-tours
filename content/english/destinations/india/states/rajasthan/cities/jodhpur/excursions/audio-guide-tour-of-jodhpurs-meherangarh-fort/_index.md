Perched on a hilltop dominating the city, Meherangarh Fort is the most visually spectacular in Rajasthan. It is approached by a series of seven gateways set at an angle so that armies could not charge them with any success. Past the gates, the fort-palace has huge courtyards surrounded by wings of palatial buildings, part of which is now turned into a fabulous museum. An excellent audio tour is included in the entrance fee, and this leads you through the museum within the Fort.   Afterwards it is well worth exploring the ramparts of the fort, with their superb views.The Jaswant Thada memorial lies on the approach to the Fort, and the large white marble structure is surrounded by the cremation grounds of former rulers.
