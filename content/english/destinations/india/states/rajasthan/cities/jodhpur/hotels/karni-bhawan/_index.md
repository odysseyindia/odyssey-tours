A charming colonial bungalow with touches of the Raj. Built in 1940s, the Karni Bhawan is considerably younger than many other heritage hotels. It offers 31 rooms,  all comfortably furnished with colourful local fabrics. There is a swimming pool and two restaurants, including one open air one with live music.
