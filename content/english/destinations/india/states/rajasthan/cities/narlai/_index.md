Narlai is a small village midway between Jodhpur and Udaipur, overlooking a gigantic single 350-foot rock of granite, dotted with caves and temples. The village has a beautifully-restored 17th-century hunting lodge. This small haveli lies cozily within fortress-like walls and the whitewashed terraces offer views of the hill with its dramatic huge granite boulder.
