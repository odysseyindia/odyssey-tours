In the centre of Bikaner is the huge Junagarh Fort, one of Rajasthan's best-preserved and most impressive. Founded in the 16th century and expanded by later rulers, it contains many stone-carved palace buildings filled with memorabilia of Rajput palace life. The different architectural styles within are also impressive. You will also visit the colourful market area, with its old havelis (merchant houses) and Jain temples.
