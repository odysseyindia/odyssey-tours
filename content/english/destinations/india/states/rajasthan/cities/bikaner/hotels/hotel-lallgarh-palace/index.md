The huge red sandstone Maharaja's palace was constructed in the beginning of the 20th century, and is a perfect example of Indo-Saracenic architecture. It is an enormously grand structure, full of ambience, with period furniture, old photos and hunting trophies. There is a restaurant, bar, and a unique historic indoor swimming pool. The bougainvillea, parakeets and peacocks add to the attraction of the gardens.
