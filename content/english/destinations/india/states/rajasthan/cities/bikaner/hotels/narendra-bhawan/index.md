The upmarket Narendra Bhawan Hotel was refurbished keeping in mind the times and life of the last reigning Maharaja of Bikaner, Narendra Singh. The building was painstakingly restored and modern amenities were added to welcome guests. It is now a chic heritage hotel with a beautiful ambience. There is now a roof-top pool, massive open courtyard, fascinating period-decorated rooms, and a lovely bar and restaurant.
