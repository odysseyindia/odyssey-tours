Bikaner grew up around the fabulous Junagarh Fort, a large 5-storey structure, the surrounding wall of which is more than a kilometre in length! Its sumptuously decorated interiors are much better preserved than any other fort in Rajasthan. The old city of Bikaner retains a medieval air with its maze of narrow lanes and some beautifully-carved havelis in red sandstone, and outside the walls, many palaces and mansions survive.
