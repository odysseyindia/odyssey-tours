  - Afternoon bullock cart trip through Barli village
---
It is great fun to explore the village of Barli by bullock cart. As you make your way through the narrow streets, you will receive a friendly greeting from all the inhabitants, especially the children. You can see traditional potters and shoe-makers at work, visit a local temple, and see the memorials to local rulers. It is a great insight into the traditional lifestyles still followed by people throughout rural India.
