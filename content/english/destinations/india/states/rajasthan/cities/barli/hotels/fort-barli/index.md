A stay at Fort Barli is a delightful way to experience rural Rajasthan. Pretty much in the middle of nowhere, off the new highway between Jaipur and Udaipur, it offers an authentic Indian experience you canâ€™t beat. Fort Barli is an intimate heritage hotel with a small number of beautiful rooms and charming lounges and courtyards, where you can relive the days of the Maharajas and explore the village and countryside in comfort.
