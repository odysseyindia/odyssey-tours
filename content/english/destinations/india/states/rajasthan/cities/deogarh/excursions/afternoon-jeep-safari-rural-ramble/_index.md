One of the not-to-be-missed activities at Deogarh is the `Rural Ramble'. This exciting excursion takes you to surrounding countryside in a jeep over undulating dunes and rocky outcrops for a thrilling journey. You drive through the narrow streets of Deogarh town, past the busy bazaar and the lakes around Deogarh, which attract a number of birds, offering some wonderful bird watching possibilities.
