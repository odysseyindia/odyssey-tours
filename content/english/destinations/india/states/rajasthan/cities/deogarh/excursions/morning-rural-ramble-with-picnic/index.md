  - Morning rural ramble with picnic
---
Deogarh lies in a fascinating, rocky, hilly part of Rajasthan, a large fort that overlooks a number of small villages. On this tour, you set off after breakfast in a jeep into the countryside. Accompanied by a local guide, you visit the villages, interact with the locals and see ancient systems, such as the bullock-turned water pumps. Finally, you have a lovely open-air picnic lunch before you return to the hotel.
