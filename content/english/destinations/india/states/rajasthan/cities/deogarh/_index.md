Deogarh is a pleasant, little-frequented town midway Pushkar and Udaipur. The market is dotted with shops selling silver jewellery, clothes, fabrics, food stuffs and just about everything one needs in a Rajasthani household. The road winds its way up to the top of the hill up to the beautifully renovated Deogarh Mahal Palace.
