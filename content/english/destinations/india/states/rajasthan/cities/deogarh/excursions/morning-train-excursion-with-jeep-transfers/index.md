This little passenger train, built in the 1930s, goes at a gentle pace through the most beautiful forest and hills in Rajasthan, a rugged, cinematic landscape. On board, you get to interact with locals who are excited to sit next to a foreigner; the bonus is monkeys and peacocks on the way. The ride ends at Phulad and then you drive back to Deogarh along a very scenic route.
