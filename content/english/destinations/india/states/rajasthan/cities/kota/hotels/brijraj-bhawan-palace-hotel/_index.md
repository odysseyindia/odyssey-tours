A colonial style royal guesthouse on the Chambal river bank. The formal drawing and dining room has the usual collection of Raj memorabilia including large oil paintings of impressive ancestors and the game trophies. Most of the 7 rooms overlook the Chambal river and are spacious and high ceilinged and are charmingly furnished with much of the original furniture.
