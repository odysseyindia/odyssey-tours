A small and delightful building, recently spruced up. There are traditional carved balconies, coloured-glass-enclosed verandahs and a lovely inner courtyard. The open terraces on various levels give good views over the town.  The haveli has only 8 rooms, all comfortably furnished using good reproduction furniture in Rajasthani or European style.
