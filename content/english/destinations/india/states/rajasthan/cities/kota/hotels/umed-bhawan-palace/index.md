Built in a mixture of Rajput and European styles, the ochre Umed Bhawan Palace is surrounded by lush lawns and flower-beds. The palace houses many original paintings, fittings and trophies, and lovely, old-world rooms and suites. Umed Bhawan was host to many dignitaries during the British Raj, including Queen Mary, who visited Kota in 1905.
