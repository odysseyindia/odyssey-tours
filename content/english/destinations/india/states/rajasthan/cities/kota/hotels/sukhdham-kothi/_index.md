A small and cozy family run mansion in serene garden surroundings. The fifteen well appointed rooms have been tastefully furnished to maintain the character of a heritage home.     Built in 1870 as a residence for the British surgeon in Kota, Sukhdham Kothi is an excellent blend of English and Indian architecture. There are open terraces, cool arcades, foliated arches and intricately carved stone screens.
