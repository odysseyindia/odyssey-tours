Kota is a rapidly-expanding industrial city and army headquarters, strung out along the east bank of the Chambal river. There is an interesting city palace and fort, part of which is open to the public. The Rao Madho Singh museum displays weapons, old costumes and some of the best preserved murals in Rajasthan. A major attraction is a boat trip on the river to dramatic cliffs, home to an enormous array of birdlife.
