If you are looking for a friendly place to stay which has a great ethical philosophy, this is the place for you. The home cooked food is made from vegetables taken straight from the lodge's organic farm and served in the dining room around a large table which makes the whole experience very sociable.     The accommodation is in 8 traditional clay huts clustered around a bourgainvillea shaded courtyard. All the rooms are beautifully decorated with regional handicrafts and feature full bathroom facilities.
