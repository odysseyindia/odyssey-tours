The 18th-century town of Nawalgarh is situated in the Shekhawati area of Rajasthan, famous for its painted havelis. The town has a colourful bazaar, two forts and numerous fine havelis. These merchants' houses are decorated with frescoes of everyday scenes of the early 20th century, as well as religious scenes. The Chhawchhariya and Poddar havelis are perhaps the most splendid in this region.
