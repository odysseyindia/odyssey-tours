This former hunting lodge is now a charming heritage hotel. The small number of rooms and suites are all delightfully different from each other. All have local Rajasthani furniture and light cottons.     There are also 5 luxury tents, pitched on an adjoining lawn, bordering an attractive swimming pool. There are several inviting places to relax with a book, such as the courtyard lawn bordered by flaming bougainvillea, or the wide verandah draped by fine muslin curtains to keep out the bright mid-day sun.
