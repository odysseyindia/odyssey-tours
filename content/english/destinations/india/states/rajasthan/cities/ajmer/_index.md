At the heart of predominantly Hindu Rajasthan is the Muslim city of Ajmer. This busy city is most famous for the shrine of the Sufi saint Mu'inuddin Chishti who was instrumental in spreading Islam throughout northern India in the 12th century. The tomb (Dargah) is now a major pilgrimage place for Moslems, particularly during the annual commemoration of the saint's death.
