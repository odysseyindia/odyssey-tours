Bundi is best known for its intricate painting style, especially frescoes and Rajasthani miniatures, often of courtly scenes from medieval Rajasthan, many telling entire stories in one fresco or painting. You can try your hand at this during a two-hour workshop with a local artist, who will guide you through this beautiful, centuries-old style, and direct you in making your very own Rajasthani miniature to take home.
