An old haveli turned into a small, chic guesthouse. Immaculate and gleaming in white, the haveli is built around a minuscule courtyard. Scalloped arches encircle the verandah restaurant and white walls set off a well-chosen collection of artefacts. The 10 tastefully furnished rooms are on the upper floors. The rooftop offers great views of the Palace complex, the hilltop Taragarh Fort beyond, especially at sunset.
