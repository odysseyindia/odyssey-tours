The former home of the prime ministers of Bundi. This 150-year-old haveli is situated in the heart of the old city, just below the fort. There are 17 simple but charmingly furnished rooms. They are scattered through the building via courtyards, terraces and corridors. The haveli has some good examples of the famous Bundi school of painting.
