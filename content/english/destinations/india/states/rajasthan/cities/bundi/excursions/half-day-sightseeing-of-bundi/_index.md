Bundi might be small, but it's packed with detail, just like its famous miniature paintings. The guided tour takes you to the astonishing Raniji ki Baori step-well, the large and un-touristy Bundi Palace, which contains beautiful frescoes within its gaunt walls, and the huge 14th-century Taragarh or Star Fort. Bundi's main market is also fascinating to walk through, with bangle sellers, flower shops and even sword sellers!
