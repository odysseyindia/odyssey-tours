  - Half day sightseeing of Bundi

Bundi might be small, but it's packed with detail, just like its famous miniature paintings. The guided tour takes you to the astonishing Raniji ki Baori step-well, the large and un-touristy Bundi Palace, which contains beautiful frescoes within its gaunt walls, and the huge 14th-century Taragarh or Star Fort. Bundi's main market is also fascinating to walk through, with bangle sellers, flower shops and even sword sellers!
