Bundi is situated in a beautiful narrow valley, dominated by the awsome 14th-century Taragarh Fort, one of the most spectacular monuments of Rajasthan. The climb up to the Fort through the colourful and friendly bazaar offers spectacular views over the town and surrounding countryside, and takes you to the Chitrashala, the picture gallery with Bundi's famous miniature paintings and delicate murals.
