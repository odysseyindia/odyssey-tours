An 18th century fort in a peaceful village setting, Fort Chanwa is a charming building converted into a hotel. The rooms are furnished with comfortable period style or Rajput furniture and local fabrics.     The red sandstone walls, broken up by lattice work and arched gateways are impressive and keep the building pleasantly cool. There is a sizeable formal garden with flaming bougainvillea. The Fort has a swimming pool with an attached sauna and steam room and a Jacuzzi. Village safaris can be organised from here.
