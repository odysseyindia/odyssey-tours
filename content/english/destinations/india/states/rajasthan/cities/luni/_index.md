Luni is a small village nestling in the shadow of Fort Chanwa, a hub of activity with artisans using centuries-old skills to fashion metal, clay or wood into intricate forms. The village elders gather under shady trees, while the children run carefree around the narrow streets. The women, swaying in brilliant Rajasthani colours, go about their daily chores to provide water and sustenance to the village.
