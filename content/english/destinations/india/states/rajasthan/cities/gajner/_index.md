Gajner is 32km from Bikaner and the site of Gajner Palace. This former hunting lodge is a miniature palace which the Maharajas of Bikaner developed as a private hunting preserve, and where they perfected the art of shikar-diplomacy. Now a National Park, Gajner harbours nilgai, chinkara, blackbuck and wild boar; winter migratory birds include the Imperial sand grouse.
