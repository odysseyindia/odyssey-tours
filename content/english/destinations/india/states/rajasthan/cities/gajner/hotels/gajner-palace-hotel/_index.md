A former royal hunting lodge, the Gajner palace is located on a lake which attracts an incredible number of birds. The surrounding forests are home to a great variety of wildlife.    A small flight of steps lead down to the jetty, from where one can board a small boat. A ride on one of these solar powered boats allows you to get close to kingfishers, storks and other wildlife in their natural habitat. This is a peaceful and serene experience.
