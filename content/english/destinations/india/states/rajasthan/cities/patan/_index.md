A small pricely state, Patan is also the site of one of the last great battles in Indian history. Called the Battle of Patan, it saw the Maratha Confedaracy pitted against the Rajputs of Jaipur and their Mughal allies in 1790. Nestled in a valley formed by 3 hills, Patan Mahal has an unhindered view of the 13th-century ancestral fort and another palace called Badal Mahal which stands loftily at an imposing 2,000 ft above sea level.
