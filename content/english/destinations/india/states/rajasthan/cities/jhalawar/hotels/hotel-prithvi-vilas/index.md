Over 130 years old, the Prithvi Vilas Hotel is a former hunting lodge that still retains its authentic grandeur. Now the Maharaja's summer residence, it has been converted into a wonderful heritage hotel. The interiors are strewn with chandeliers and sepia photos, the rooms have been modernised, but still offer rustic charm, and the palace grounds are charmingly overgrown, with peacocks strolling about.
