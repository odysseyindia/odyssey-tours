Jhalawar is located in the south-east corner of Rajasthan, bordering Madhya Pradesh. It is an interesting place full of forts, palaces and temples. During the full moon night of the Kartik month (14 days after Diwali),  a cattle fair is held and people take a holy dip in the river and float lit lamps into the river as an offering of worship.
