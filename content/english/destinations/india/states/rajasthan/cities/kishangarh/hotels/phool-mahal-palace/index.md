The old fort of Kishangarh provides a mysterious background to the delicate Phool Mahal palace, a combination of Rajasthani architecture and distinctive European touches.     The lounge and the main dining area overlook the lake which attracts hundreds of resident and migratory birds. The Phool Mahal belongs to the royal family of Kishangarh, famous for its miniature school of painting.
