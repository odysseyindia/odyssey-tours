On the way from Jaipur to Ajmer is the small princely town of Kishangarh. Founded in the 17th century, Kishangarh has one of India's most renowned schools of miniature paintings, and the royal family has always patronized the arts. Their monsoon garden retreat is Phool Mahal Palace, by a lovely lake under an old fort. There is a workshop near the entrance of Phool Mahal, where you can see artists at work.
