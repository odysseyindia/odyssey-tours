The 56 sq km enclave of Daman is situated in the south of Gujarat. Once a Portuguese colony along with Diu, they both today constitute a union territory. Surrounded by the Arabian sea it enjoys a tropical flavour. Major attractions are the bars along the beach because Daman is the only place in the whole of otherwise dry Gujarat where one can buy alcohol. The town itself though sleepy  has the remnants of some fine old forts and churches built by the Portuguese.
