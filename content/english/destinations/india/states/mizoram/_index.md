Mizoram cannot boast of five star facilities nor of any exceptional amenities and tourist services. Except for visitors from various Christian organizations, persons on official visits and the odd research scholar, few tourists visit Mizoram.    This is sure to change in the future as Mizoram is a very attractive state with a friendly a very hospitable population, a wide array of festivals and dances, handicrafts, flora and fauna, breathtaking natural beauty and temperate climate.
