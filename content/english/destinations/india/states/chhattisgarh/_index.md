Far away from India's regular tourist destinations, the remote and thickly forested tribal areas of Chhatisgarh in central India offer access to one of the country's last unexplored frontiers.     The local tribal population leads a life close to nature which is reflected in their arts and crafts fashioned out of clay, wood, metal and cotton. Tribal markets make for attractive display of these arts and crafts, and a common place for communities to gather and celebrate.
