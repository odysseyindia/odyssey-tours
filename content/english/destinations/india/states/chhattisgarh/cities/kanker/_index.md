Far away from India's regular tourist destinations, Kanker offers access to one of the country's last unexplored frontiers - the tribal region of Bastar. The tribal districts of Kanker and Bastar straddle central India's eastern uplands and plateau, and are covered with one of its richest stretches of tropical forest. A visit to this region provides a rare opportunity to experience the tribal lifestyles and heritage.
