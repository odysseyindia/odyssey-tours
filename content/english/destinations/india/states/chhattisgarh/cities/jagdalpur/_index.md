Jagdalpur is the district headquarters of the tribal region of Bastar, a virtual museum of tribal life and arts. At any time of year, tribals, in the distinctive dress, headgear, and ornaments of their tribe, can be seem sitting or walking around its tree-lined roads. Workshops scattered about the town preserve and encourage an array of brilliant handicraft, developed with industry and ingenuity by a people living amid nature.
