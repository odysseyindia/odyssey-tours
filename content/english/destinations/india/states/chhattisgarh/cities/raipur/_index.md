Raipur, capital of Chhattisgarh, is fast becoming an important air and rail gateway to the once-remote interiors of Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh such as Kanha (231 km),  Kawardha (114 km) and Kanker (133 km). This region is home to a unique concentration of tribal people and numerous wildlife sanctuaries. A small but growing network of royal residences is now able to welcome limited numbers of discerning guests.
