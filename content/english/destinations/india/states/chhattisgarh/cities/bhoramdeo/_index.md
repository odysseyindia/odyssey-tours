Bhoramdeo is a small village in the largely tribal state of Chhattisgarh. The Maikal Hills that surround Bhoramdeo are home to many species of central India's spectacular wildlife as well as to the indigenous Baiga & Gond tribes, whose tolas (villages) dot the countryside. Bhoramdeo is also known for its 11th-century temple complex, a miniature local Khajuraho of similar antiquity but rather more exclusive.
