  - Guided visit to local tribal villages
---
With a local guide, you will visit nearby villages and meet villagers without formality or embarrassment. You might visit a potter (and trying your hand at the wheel), a bamboo-craft centre, cow herders and Agaria (blacksmith) villages. There are also colourful weekly haats (tribal markets) on almost every day of the week, where you can meet the forest-dwelling Baiga aborigines, with their unique, 20,000-year-old culture.
