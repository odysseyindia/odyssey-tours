An elegant 1930s building with the touches you'd expect in a Maharaja's home. There are Italian marble floors, stuffed tigers and old European bathroom fittings. The palace offers 6 elegantly appointed suites with many pieces of period furniture. Guests can relax in the Durbar Hall or Office Lounge. Your stay is on full board basis and includes local excursions.
