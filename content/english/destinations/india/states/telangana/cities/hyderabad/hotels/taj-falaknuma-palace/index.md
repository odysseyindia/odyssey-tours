The erstwhile residence of the Nizam of Hyderabad has now been converted by the Taj Hotels into a luxury heritage hotel. The palace offers unique rooms with 2 restaurants, an outdoor pool and the Jiva Spa, all with splendid architecture and decor. What was once the sole preserve of visiting royalty like King Edward VIII and the last Russian Tsar, Nicholas II, will now be yours to discover. We are sure the Royal family approve!
