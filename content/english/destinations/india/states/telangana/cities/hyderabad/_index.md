The twin city of Hyderabad-Secunderabad is a mixture of Muslim and Hindu cultures. Its history as the centre of Muslim India from the 16th century can best be appreciated at the massive Golconda Fort. This mighty hilltop fortress saw frequent battles and remains one of the most impressive in India. The old city is found around the famous Charminar gate, and this predominantly Muslim area is fascinating to explore.
