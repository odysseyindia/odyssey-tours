Warangal is a cotton market town north-east of Hyderabad. It was the capital of the Kakatiya kingdom, which flourished in the 12th and 13th centuries. The Hindu Kakatiyas were great patrons of the arts and during their reign the Chalukyan style of temple architecture reached its pinnacle. You can still see the impressive Warangal Fort and the  '1,000 pillar' Shiva temple on the nearby Hanamakonda Hill.
