Maharashtra has a beautiful long coast line with countless inlets, ridges and valleys, and is known for its ancient forts. Inland, parallel to the Arabian Sea, are the Western Ghats, with their own range of forts and picturesque hill stations.   Cradled in the centre of the state is the Deccan Plateau, site of ancient cave paintings and rock-cut architecture at Ajanta and Ellora. To the east are verdant hills and jungles, home to some rarely visited but interesting wildlife parks.
