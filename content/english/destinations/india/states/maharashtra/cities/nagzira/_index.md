Nagzira Wildlife Sanctuary is a miraculously-preserved green oasis in the easternmost part of Maharashtra state, the heart of central India, which has almost 1/6th of the total tiger population of India. The reserve has great bio-diversity, and picturesque landscapes and luxuriant vegetation; look for tigers, leopards, wild dogs called dhole, and plenty of bird-life.
