Food speaks volumes about the world's cultures, and nowhere more so than Mumbai - a city best experienced through its diverse and delicious street food. You join a small group to experience all the flavours the city has to offer. We first visit Chowpatty Beach, the best place to taste Mumbai's vegetarian favourites such as pav bhaji and pani puri. You also get to try sweets, such as hand-churned ice cream in unfamiliar flavours at a 120-year-old shop, and a super-sugary, bright orange jalebi.     


We then visit the bazaars of the Muslim-dominated Mohammed Ali Road, known for its khau gallis (eating lanes), where you get to try Mumbai classics such as bhel puri, and kebabs, as well as some lesser-known foods unique to this area, such as offal. While some of the items we can try here are non-vegetarian, there are also plenty of options for vegetarians.
