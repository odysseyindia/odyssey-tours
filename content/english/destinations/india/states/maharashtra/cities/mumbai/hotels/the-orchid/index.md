A delightful airport hotel, which has been awarded the `Ecotel' mark for its environmentally sound policies. The air-conditioned  rooms offer great in-room hospitality. The central atrium floods the building with a lot of natural light. The hotel has three restaurants, including an excellent coffee shop, and a bar, plus a rooftop swimming pool.
