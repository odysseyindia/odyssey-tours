This comfortable mid-range hotel has an enviable location near the Gateway of India and the famous Taj Mahal Hotel. It overlooks the Mumbai harbour, and there is a magnificent, unrestricted sea view from the breezy rooftop restaurant and bar. The rooms are compact, but well furnished, with good modern bathrooms. Colaba Causeway, the best-known shopping centre in South Mumbai, is also nearby.
