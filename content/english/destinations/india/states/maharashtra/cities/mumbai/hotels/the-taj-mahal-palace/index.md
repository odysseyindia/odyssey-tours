A gracious landmark on the waterfront facing the Gateway of India, The Taj Mahal Hotel was built in 1905 using dark coloured stone with creme coloured facings. It is a fabulous piece of indigenous architecture. The opulent rooms are divided between the Old and New Wing. There are multiple restaurants and a swimming pool. The Taj Mahal Hotel is one of the `Leading Hotels of the World'.
