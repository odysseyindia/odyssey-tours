Mumbai's most famous landmark is the `Gateway of India', a triumphal archway built to commemorate the visit of King George V and Queen Mary to India in 1911. Nearby is the Prince of Wales Museum, which holds a vast collection of Chinese jade pieces, Victorian oil paintings and weaponry of the Mughal era.     The Hanging Gardens are situated on Malabar Hill, on the Western side of the city. A panoramic view of the city can be seen from these gardens. On the drive from the Gateway of India to the Hanging Gardens you pass some of Mumbai's best heritage buildings. Mani Bhawan is the house in which Mahatma Gandhi stayed when he was in Bombay, and it is now a museum. There is also a photo stop at Dhobi Ghat, a huge open-air laundry.
