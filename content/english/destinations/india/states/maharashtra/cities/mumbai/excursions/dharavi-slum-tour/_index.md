This private tour takes you to Dharavi, once famous only as a slum but now a hive of small cottage industries, and a microcosm of India, its diversity apparent in the temples, mosques, churches and pagodas that stand side by side. En route, you will pass through the red-light area, and stop off at Dhobi Ghat, a huge open-air laundry. The guide will also talk about issues affecting the poorer members of society, the street children, pavement dwellers, the history of the slums, etc. Dharavi houses about one million of Mumbai's inhabitants and its industries have an annual turnover of approximately US$ 665 million. During your walk you will witness a wide range of these business activities: recycling, pottery-making, embroidery, bakery, soap-making, leather-tanning, poppadom-making and many more.
