  - Mumbai heritage walk
---
Starting with the iconic Gateway of India, we explore the Colaba and Fort areas of Mumbai on foot, best done in the mornings. Mumbai's most distinctive colonial-era architecture is found here, in buildings such as the Prince of Wales Museum, the High Court, and the University. The street life is also fascinating. On weekdays the walk ends at Churchgate railway station, where the famous 'dabba-wallas' arrange the distribution of thousands of 'tiffin boxes' - packed lunches for office workers which they transport from suburban residences to offices throughout South Mumbai. From here, the guide will arrange a taxi to return to the hotel.
