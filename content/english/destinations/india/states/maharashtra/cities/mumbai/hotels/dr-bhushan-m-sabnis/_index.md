The Bison is situated at the confluence of the Bandipur and Nagarhole National Parks, on the shores of the Kabini River in Karnataka, run by avid naturalists and conservationists. The tents are a beautiful combination of the East African Camps and the old Hunting Lodges of the Raj, with a spectacular view of the forest, backwaters and sunset. All rooms have an outdoor veranda with chairs that overlook the forest. It is not at all uncommon to spot elephants grazing, gaur, boar, hundreds of deer and sometimes even a big cat, from your tents (there is even a resident leopard!).
