This 3 star hotel has been completely re-furbished recently and makes for an excellent mid-range choice in Mumbai.     Located at Byculla, Hotel Heritage is a short drive away from Mumbai's main attractions and monuments: the Gateway of India, the Jehangir Art Gallery, the Prince of Wales Museum and the Victoria Terminus.      The Heritage is also very conveniently located close to the 3 main railway stations of Mumbai.
