Lonavala, along with Khandala, is part of a twin hill resort in the Sahyadri hills between Mumbai and Pune. For visitors, the chief asset of Lonavala is the proximity to the nearby Karla and Bhaja caves. These rock-cut caves date to the second century BC and are among the oldest and finest examples of Buddhist rock temple art. The largest of the caves is at Karla, whilst the nearby Bhaja caves have a more impressive setting.
