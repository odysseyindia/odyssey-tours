Neral is a railway station between Mumbai and Pune.  A narrow-gauge heritage railway connects Neral to the hill station of Matheran. It covers a distance of 21 km, cutting a swathe through forest to the top of the plateau. The railway track was built between 1901 and 1907 by Abdul Hussein Adamjee Peerbhoy and financed by his father, Sir Adamjee Peerbhoy, who visited Matheran often, and wanted to build a railway to make it easier to get there.
