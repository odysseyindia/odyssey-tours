Matheran, a charming hill station close to Mumbai, can be reached by an adventurous two-hour ascent in a toy train. Cars are not allowed in the town, so everyone walks or rides a cycle or horse. There are beautiful walks amongst Matheran's forest trails and the views are stunning. Matheran was a popular retreat during the British Raj, and the colonial bungalows testify to this period. The main bazaar offers cane and leather articles, hats, chappals and the sinfully sweet speciality, chikki.
