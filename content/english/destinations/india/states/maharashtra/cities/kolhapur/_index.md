A little-visited city, Kolhapur is a city in the southwest of Maharashta, only a few hours’ drive from Goa. Kolhapur’s famous sights include its palaces, temples and lakes, while its must-have experiences include shopping for saris, jewellery and its fabled leather chappals as well as savouring its spicy Kolhapuri cuisine, especially chicken and mutton dishes.
