Built in 1932-34 as the residence of the Maharajah of Kolhapur, the Shalini Palace is set a lake-side surrounded by peaceful and lush gardens. The palace is built in dark grey/black  coloured stone and is a blend of several styles. There are scalloped arches set with etched Belgiun glass whilst the interiors are rich with wooden carvings and Italian marble. In 1987 the palace was converted into a hotel with 42 spacious rooms, charmingly furnished with period furniture.
