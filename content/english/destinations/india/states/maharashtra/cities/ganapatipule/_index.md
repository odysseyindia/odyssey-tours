The tiny beach resort of Ganpatipule is located mid-way between Mumbai and Goa. It is frequented by lots of domestic tourists, particularly during holidays such as Diwali or Ganesh Chaturthi when they turn up to visit the seaside Shree Ganpatipule Mandir, which houses a monolithic Ganesh (painted a bright orange). Despite its relative popularity, the beach at Ganapatipule remains quiet and clean.
