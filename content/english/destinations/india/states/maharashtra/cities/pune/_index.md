Pune is the cultural capital of Maharashtra, where education, arts and crafts, and theatre are given due prominence. It has one of India's oldest universities and numerous colleges, and of course the famous Osho ashram. Pune's old city area is peppered with narrow, winding roads but the newer areas are more open and spacious. Though mostly a Marathi-speaking community, Pune is slowly becoming a more cosmopolitan city.
