A distinctive art deco building with large palatial rooms and plush antique furnishings situated amidst lush green surroundings reminiscent of the style & splendor of the bygone royal heritage of the Maharajas.    The hotel is right next to the Osho Commune in Koregaon Park, an area with many beautiful old trees. The 56 rooms are comfortably furnished but do vary in quality. There is a very good vegetarian restaurant.
