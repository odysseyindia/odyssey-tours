Nashik is a bustling blend of the ancient and modern, dotted with numerous forts and majestic temples.  It is part of the green belt, renowned for its variety of fruits and vegetables, particularly strawberries, onions and grapes - this is the wine capital of India. The Kumbh Mela, the greatest and most important of Hindu periodical fairs, is celebrated here every 12 years.
