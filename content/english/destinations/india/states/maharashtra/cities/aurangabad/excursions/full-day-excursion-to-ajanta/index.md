The Ajanta Caves reflect the peak of ancient Indian art and architecture. The caves were cut in rocky cliffs above a horseshoe-shaped valley to provide prayer halls and a place of residence for Buddhist monks. Craftworkers cut out the rock and sculpted it while others made beautiful murals depicting places, royalty, culture and tales of everyday life in ancient India.
