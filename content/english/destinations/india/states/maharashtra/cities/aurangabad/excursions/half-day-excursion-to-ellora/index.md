Artists worked at the cave site of Ellora, 30 km from Aurangabad, from the sixth century A.D. till about 1000 A.D. They created Buddhist, Hindu, and Jain caves next to each other.     The masterpiece at Ellora is the astonishing temple dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva. It is the world's largest monolithic sculpture, carved out of one single rock cliff by 7000 labourers over a 150 year period. The workers started at the top and gradually cut downward, an amazing feat of architecture with no room for improvisation or error. The temple is called the Kailasha temple, taking its name from Mount Kailash, a Tibetan peak in the Himalaya considered to be a divine axis between heaven and earth, where the Hindus believe Shiva lives.
