Built by Aurangzeb's son as a mausoleum to his mother, the Bibi-Ka-Maqbara is the finest example of Mughal architecture in the Deccan plateau. Modeled on the Taj Mahal, it is about half its size. Panchakki is a 17th-century water mill, famous for its underground water channel. The Aurangabad Caves, hacked into a high hillside cleft, are a World Heritage Site from the Buddhist era.
