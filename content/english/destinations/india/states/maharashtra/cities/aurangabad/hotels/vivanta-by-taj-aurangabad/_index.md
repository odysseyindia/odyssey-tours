The Vivanta by Taj in Aurangabad is a low, sprawling white building with Mughal-style cupolas, arches, and even an onion-shaped dome. The hotel's rooms are set amongst lovingly landscaped and terraced lawns. The rooms are pleasantly appointed with all standard facilities. There is a 24-hour coffee shop, a multi-cuisine restaurant and a bar. For recreation, there is a swimming pool and a health centre.
