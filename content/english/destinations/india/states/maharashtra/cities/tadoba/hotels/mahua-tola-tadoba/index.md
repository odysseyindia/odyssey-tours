Mahua Tola Tadoba, well located for two of Tadoba's gates, is surrounded by dense forest. The property has airy cottages, suites, and rooms with separate sit-out areas, ideal for nature walks, morning tea and coffee, and long hours of reading. A river passes just outside, and the resort, set away from others in the area, often has tigers and leopards walking in the property - a stamp of the wildness of this resort!
