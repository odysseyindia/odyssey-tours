Tigertrails is a private jungle lodge run by Amrut Dhanwatay and his son Aditya. They are keen wildlife enthusiasts who know the Tadoba Tiger Reserve better than anyone else.     The jungle lodge is situated close to the core area of the park in a large private forest. The lodge has seven simply furnished rooms and a garden where meals are often served around a bonfire.
