  - Morning and afternoon jeep safaries in Tadoba National Park
---
Morning and afternoon jeep rides will ensure that you make the most of your visit to Tadoba. With one of the highest tiger populations, your chances of spotting one on a shared jeep safari is high. The park is also home to a variety of deer - chital, sambhar, barking deer, chausingha, as well as leopards, bears and civets. Marsh crocodiles are often seen in the lakes, and birds here include the paradise flycatcher, crested serpent eagle and nightjar.
