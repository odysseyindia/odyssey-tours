Nestling in the Sahyadri range of the Western Ghats, Mahabaleshwar was the summer capital of the erstwhile Bombay presidency. A popular town, with an air of unspoilt beauty, Mahabaleshwar is great for walks as there are many points with panoramic views over the valley and the sea. It is also possible to go boating or fishing at the placid Venna Lake or swim in the crystal waters of the numerous waterfalls. There is an interesting bazaar with tiny lanes where you can shop for everything from shoes to luscious strawberries, blackberries, jams and jellies.
