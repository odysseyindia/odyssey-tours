The former Portuguese colony of Goa is famous for its easy-going ambience, good food, and lovely climate. It boasts a coastline with beautiful beaches; palm-fringed rivers, lush scenery with paddy fields, mango groves and whitewashed villas. Evidence of its glorious past can be seen in the unique Indo-Portuguese style of its magnificent baroque churches, its stately ancestral mansions and its historic forts.
