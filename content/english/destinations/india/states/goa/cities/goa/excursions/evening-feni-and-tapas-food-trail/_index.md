Partake in a vivid narrative of Goan cuisine in this join-in trail through Panjim, where you discover feni, an  olfactory overload of a liquor distilled from cashew fruit and palm sap, and hear stories about Goan cuisine, with its Portuguese, Indian and East African influences. This trail, more a cultural experience than a typical pub crawl, includes some of the most iconic places for Goan food, paired with the best feni and feni-based cocktails.
