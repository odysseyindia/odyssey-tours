Panchavatti is a small luxury home stay (or a tiny boutique hotel), tucked away on a hilltop overlooking one of Mandovi river's tributaries. Having said that, Panchavatti is still just twenty minutes drive away to the nearest beach!     Panchavatti's gardens that cover the slope to the river are planted with trees that are home to many birds. Down near the river, small perches invite guests to sit by and enjoy the beauty of the river and the mangroves.
