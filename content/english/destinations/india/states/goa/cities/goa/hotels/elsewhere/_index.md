A slim slice of pure paradise, the Elsewhere villas - the Captain's House, the Piggery, the Bakery and the Priest's House - straddle a narrow piece of land between the sea and a creek. The rustic villas sit well away from each other and house a world of comfort within. Their earthy coloured walls and fat white balustrades shelter lounge chairs and fluffy beds, right by one of the most beautiful beaches in Goa.
