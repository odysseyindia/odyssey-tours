Step back in time at Palácio do Deão, in the quaint village of Quepem. This palatial house was built by a Portuguese priest in the 18th century. The current owner has restored it beautifully, and will take you on a tour to show you the wonderful architecture and artefacts, and the magical tropical garden. After the tour, you sit down to a feast on the leafy verandah, where you're treated to an elaborate Indo-Portuguese lunch.
