This farmstay, near Netravali Wildlife Sactuary, is a Goa far removed from parties and crowded beaches. The rooms are modest but comfy, and there's a pool, yoga/meditation space, and many reading corners. Cheerful local women make great meals using organic produce straight from the farm.  There's much to do here - planting or picking veggies, visits to the village and the school, trekking to the waterfall, birding and more.
