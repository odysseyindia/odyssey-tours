The Kerkar Retreat is a guesthouse that has grown organically out of the art gallery belonging to Goaâ€™s celebrated artist, Dr. Subodh Kerkar.   The Retreat, situated a mere 300 meters away from Calangute beach, only houses 6 rooms all of which are spacious and clean.     The mainly white walls form a larger canvas for art and guests spend a considerable amount of time gazing at local Goan scenes expertly recreated in oil and water colours by the owner.     Your Goan experience here will be rounded off by the superb Goan Hindu food served by the in-house restaurant called 'Waves'.
