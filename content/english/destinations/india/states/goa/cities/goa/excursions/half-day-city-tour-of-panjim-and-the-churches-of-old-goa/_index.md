Panjim, the capital of Goa, is the smallest and most pleasant of state capitals. The old town has still preserved its Portuguese heritage remarkably well, with overhanging balconies and red-tiled roofs, white-washed churches and numerous small cafes and bars. In Old Goa, the churches of the Se Cathedral, Basilica of Bom Jesus and the St Francis Church are monuments to the legacy left behind by the Portuguese.
