In the heart of the colourful village of Anjuna is the 200 year old yellow and white Hotel Bougainvillea, affectionately called Granpa's Inn.     Here, you will find lush gardens, a large swimming pool and cool, cosy rooms that offer a shady retreat just minutes from the weekly flea market and Anjuna beach.     The Hibiscus restaurant spills over from the shady wrap around verandah of the house onto the lawns and is decorated in a nostalgic 1970's style of purple and mauve.
