Dwarka is a very laid-back place - perfect for a few days of undisturbed relaxation. On the remote, unspoilt Kola Beach in South Goa, this small resort is draped over a terraced hillside. The comfortable rooms have colorful en-suite bathrooms and private balconies offering fabulous views over the beach and the lagoon. All meals are included in your stay, and are served in the open-air restaurant facing the beautiful beach.
