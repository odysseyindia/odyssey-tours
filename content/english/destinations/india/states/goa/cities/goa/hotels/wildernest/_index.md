About an hour and half drive from the beaches of North Goa, and surrounded by hills and forests, Wildernest is for the true nature lover.     The resort offers wooden cottages, each with a sit-out or a verandah to enjoy the views. There are naturalist-guided walks and hikes. For the more sedate guests, there is a swimming pool with the most dramatic views in Goa.
