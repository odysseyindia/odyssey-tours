Olavipe Homestay is a lovely old Keralan home on an island in the backwaters, a little north of Alleppey. Set on an organic farm, the house has four large airy bedrooms, for guests in the main building, and two rooms in the converted gate house accessible by wheelchair, with individual garden space. There are modern bathrooms attached to all the bedrooms.       Breakfast, lunch and dinner are with the family and other guests around the family dining table. Food here is mostly traditional Kerala cuisine - with ingredients sourced from the farm, village and the lagoon.       Activities at Olavipe Homestay      You can explore the backwaters on foot, bicycle or on the family's little boat. The estate's lagoon is safe, even for the novice, to row a canoe and feel the serenity of the waters. And if you'd like to do something different, you can browse through the family archives - a treasure-trove of old family documents, letters, photographs and rare documents highlighting Kerala's social fabric of the last two centuries.
