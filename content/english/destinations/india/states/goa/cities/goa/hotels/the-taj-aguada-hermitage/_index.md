A deluxe resort with breathtaking views of the Arabian Sea. Perched atop a hill above the Fort Aguada, this resort was originally built for a Commonwealth Heads of State meeting. Each head of state had a private garden villa with private verandah. This immaculate place shares all dining and sports facilities with the Fort Aguada and Taj Holiday Village.
