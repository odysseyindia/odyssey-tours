A lovely boutique hotel with a swimming pool and a thatched restaurant.     Presa di Goa has only seven rooms, each named after a flower. Rooms are furnished in Goan/Portuguese style with balconies that overlook the garden below.     Inside the rooms, there are four poster beds, magnificent wardrobes, planter's chairs and treasure chests. Well chosen paintings and little artefacts adorn the walls.
