Apart from the beaches, Goa offers dramatic cliffs with spectacular views, on one of which perches the Cabo Serai resort. An eco-conscious resort, it tries to bring the outdoors in: the luxurious villas and tents offer excellent views and a natural, calming feel. Yoga and wellness are a big part of the stay, and birding is encouraged. Meals can be had in various spots around the property, from the beach to coconut groves.
