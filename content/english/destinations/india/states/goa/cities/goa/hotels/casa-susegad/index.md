This beautifully restored Portuguese-era colonial mansion has 5 comfortable and spacious guest rooms - the smaller ones have air conditioning, whereas the 2 larger rooms are kept cool by the high ceilings and large fans. All have sitouts, there is a swimming pool, a garden with hammocks, an area for yoga and meditation, and copious birdlife. The owners, staff and resident cats and dogs are all very friendly and welcoming!
