A great, family-friendly resort on famous Candolim beach, with rooms ranged around a central swimming pool area and lawns, and great access to the sea. The rooms are pleasant and comfortable, all with balconies with views of the garden, pool or sea. There are many dining options nearby, but the resort has its own outstanding Asian restaurant-cum-lounge, which you shouldn't miss! A good option for a beach holiday.
