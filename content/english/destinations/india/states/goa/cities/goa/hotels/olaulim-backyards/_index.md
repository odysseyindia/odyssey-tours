Olaulim Backyards is located in one of Goa's most picturesque, peaceful spots. A small homestay, it offers fan- and breeze-cooled cottages made out of local bamboo, laterite stone and wood, over many lakeside acres. Natural boulders are kept intact and the beds are built around them, and the semi-outdoor bathrooms are delightful and well planned. Each room offers verandahs overlooking the forest or the lake. A lagoon-shaped pool, hammocks, kayaks and cycles offer plenty of active possibilities, watched over by a pony, dogs, and even a donkey! The meals are fresh and tasty, and the whole setup gives you a very different Goan experience.
