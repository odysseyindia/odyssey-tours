A small, modern hotel, Little Palace is comfortably located in a relatively quiet area of the city.     The rooms, especially the higher priced ones are spacious, light and airy. Some of the corner rooms on the upper level have a view over the Brahmaputra river. The furniture, if not luxurious, is comfortable.     Little Palace has a multi-cuisine restaurant at the lobby level which is quite popular, with its comfortable seating and attentive service.
