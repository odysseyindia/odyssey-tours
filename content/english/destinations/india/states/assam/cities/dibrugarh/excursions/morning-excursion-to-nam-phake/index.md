An interesting attraction is Namphake village, about 60km northeast of Dibrugarh, and home to some 150 families of the Tai Phake tribe. This Thai tribe migrated to Assam in the 18th century. With them they brought their language and customs, which they nurture even today. They live in traditional houses of bamboo and thatch and weave their own colourful fabrics. Thereâ€™s also a charming Buddhist monastery in the town.
