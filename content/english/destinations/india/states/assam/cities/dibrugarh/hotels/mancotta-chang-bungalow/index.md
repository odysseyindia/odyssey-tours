Set in lush gardens bordering an old tea estate, Mancotta Chang Bungalow is a wonderful heritage hotel just outside Dibrugarh. Mancotta Chang Bungalow has sloping green roofs, wraparound verandahs and an old-world elegance. The upper-level rooms are excellent with old wooden floors and period furniture. A traveler can easily spend quality time here sipping tea on the porch while looking out at the surrounding tea plantation.
