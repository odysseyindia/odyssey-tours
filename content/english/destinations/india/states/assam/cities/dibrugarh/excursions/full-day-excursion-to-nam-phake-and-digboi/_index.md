An interesting attraction is Nam Phake village, about 60km northeast of Dibrugarh, and home to some 150 families of the Tai Phake tribe. This Thai tribe migrated to Assam in the 18th century. With them they brought their language and customs, which they nurture even today. They live in traditional houses of bamboo and thatch and weave their own colourful fabrics. Thereâ€™s also a charming Buddhist monastery in the town.    Digboi is a famous oil town at the extreme north-eastern corner of India. At the spot of Asia's very first oil well is now a quaint museum. You can also visit the Digboi War Cemetery. It has 200 graves of different Allied Forces personnel from UK, India, West Africa, Burma, Belgium, USA and Italy who sacrificed their lives during the Second World War.
