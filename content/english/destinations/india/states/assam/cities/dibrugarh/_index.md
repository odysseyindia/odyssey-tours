Totally rebuilt after a devastating earthquake in 1950, the new town of Dibrugarh lies on the banks of the Brahmaputra in Upper Assam. It is the perfect place to experience and enjoy the richness of Assam's tea gardens. Dibrugarh district is the highest producer of tea in Assam. It is not unusual to find large areas surrounded by tea estates, and green expanses of tea gardens in the middle of the city itself!
