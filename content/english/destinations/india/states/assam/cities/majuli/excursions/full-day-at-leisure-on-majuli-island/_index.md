Today you can visit more monasteries if you wish (the biggest one is nearby and has a museum and a large library), but you may also prefer to simply walk around the village surrounding the hotel, or cycle around the island.   

It is easy to forget that Majuli is an island, holding within it hills, vast open paddy fields, rivulets, dry sandy river beds and corpses of thick trees. Majuli falls along a major migratory path for ducks, geese and other birds. As a result, an extra-ordinary large number of birds can be seen here, even just simply by driving or cycling around.
