Due to a wonderful initiative of the council of the Mishing tribe in Majuli island, tribal people built and run a small resort in exactly the same style of their own traditional homes.    Po Okum is an eco camp consisting of several bamboo huts perched on stilts a few metres above the ground that can be accessed by sturdy wooden steps. There is a pleasant sit-out in the front which catches the breeze.
