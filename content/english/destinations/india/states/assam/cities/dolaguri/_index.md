Dolaguri is a tea estate in Assam, not far from Kaziranga Wildlife Sanctuary. Rows of tall bushes follow the contours of the rolling hills, to be plucked at harvest time by women with wicker baskets strapped to their heads. Originally a local tribal drink, tea went global under the British a century ago. India is the world's largest producer of tea, and Assam produces 60% of this total. Half of Assam's produce is exported.
