Sivasagar in Assam was once the capital of the Ahom Kings. The Shans, who came from Thailand to this area in the early 13th century, ruled for 600 years till the British domination started. The ruins of the Ahom palaces, temples and pavilions still dot the landscape, and they show the richness of this highly evolved and advanced civilization. The Shiva temple has the highest spire in the whole of Assam.
