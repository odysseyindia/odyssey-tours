The spectacular Diphlu River Lodge is located on the banks of the Diphlu river, at the edge of the Kaziranga National Park. The large wooden cottages, all vernacular architecture on stilts, boast all necessary comforts and surround an attractive rice paddy.  There are several comfortable vantage points over the river to the National Park, where wildlife is often seen. This is the most luxurious base from which to explore Kaziranga, and to enjoy relaxation in comfortable surroundings between safaris.
