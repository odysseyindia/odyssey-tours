Kaziranga was declared a game reserve in 1926 to save the Indian one-horned rhino from extinction. The beautiful sanctuary features various habitats, from swampland to jungle, and deciduous forests to evergreen slopes. You can take jeep and elephant safaris to spot the famous rhinos and a wide array of other animals, from wild buffaloes to delicate swamp deer and elusive tigers and a wide variety of birds.
