This route traverses the eastern portion of the park, called Agaratulli. It is the only route that follows the Bhrahmaputra river. Sightings of rhinos are infrequent, but this area is excellent for birding. You can spot nests of the globally-threatened Pallas's fish eagle and a colony of spot-billed pelicans. Migrant waterfowl may be observed at Sohola Beel. Various woodland birds can be seen along the drive through the very scenic Dillenia Swamp Forest. Elephants may be encountered, as well as water buffalo and swamp deer.
