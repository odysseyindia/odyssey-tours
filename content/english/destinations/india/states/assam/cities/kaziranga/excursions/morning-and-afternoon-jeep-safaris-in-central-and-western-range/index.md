  - Morning and afternoon jeep safaris in Central and Western Range
---
The jeep safari in the Central Range is an ideal introduction to the park, as the route passes through the entire spectrum of habitats in Kaziranga  area. You might spot elephants and other big animals, especially the swamp buffalo and of course the rhino. The rare swamp deer are seen in groups In the extensive short grass next to the wetlands, and the birdlife is prolific.     The jeep safari in the Western Range traverses the southwest portion of the park which has maximum short grass areas, the optimum habitat for rhino and water buffaloes. Part of the drive is also through low alluvial savannah woodland. You can see the colonization of grassland by Lagerstroemia Parviflora. You can spot mainly grassland and water birds as well as raptors, swamp francolin, chestnut-capped babbler, black-faced and yellow-breasted buntings and Finn's weaver.
