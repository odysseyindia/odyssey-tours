An ideal introduction to the park and its ecology, as the route  passes through the  entire spectrum of habitats in Kaziranga. A stretch of the route  goes along the Diphlu river, a tributary of the Brahmaputra. There is a possibility of sighting elephants as well as swamp buffalo and of course the rhino. The rare swamp deer are seen in groups In the extensive short grass next to the wetlands, and the birdlife is prolific. Amongst other birds you can spot Pallas's fish eagle, lesser adjutant stork, swamp francolin, spot-billed pelican, and other water birds such as bar-headed goose, grey-headed lapwing, black-necked stork, etc.    Part of the game drive is also through woodlands. Here the key species are khaleej pheasant, Himalayan flameback, streak-throated woodpecker, several species of parakeet, greenish and inornate warblers, blue-bearded bee-eater, etc.
