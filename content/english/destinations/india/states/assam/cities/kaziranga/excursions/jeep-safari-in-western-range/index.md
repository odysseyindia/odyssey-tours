This route traverses the southwest portion of the park which has maximum short grass areas and is the optimum habitat for rhino and water buffaloes. The Dunga Tower presents a panorama of short-grass-edged wetland, patches of tall grassland and woodland in the background. Part of the drive is also through low alluvial savannah woodland. You can see the colonization of grassland by Lagerstroemia parviflora. You can spot mainly grassland and water birds as well as raptors, swamp Francolin, chestnut-capped babbler, black-faced and yellow-breasted buntings and maybe Finn's weaver.
