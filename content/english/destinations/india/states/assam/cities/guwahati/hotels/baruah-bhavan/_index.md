This small, welcoming and homely guest house in a relatively well ordered part of the city is just a few minutes walk form the banks of the Brahmaputra River and interesting markets. The 6 guest rooms are simply furnished, but are comfortable, and have air conditioning and en-suite bathrooms. There is usually a very friendly atmosphere in the old fashioned lounge and around the communal dining table, making this the perfect place to start or end a visit to North East India.
