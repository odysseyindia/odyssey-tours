The Kamakhya Temple, located on Nilachal Hill, is an important centre for Tantric Hinduism and Sakti worship. East of the town centre, atop another hill, is the atmospheric Navagraha temple - the "temple of the nine planets". The Assam State Museum, Ambari, is a window into Assam's history, culture and crafts. Particularly interesting are the dioramas of Assamese tribal villages.
