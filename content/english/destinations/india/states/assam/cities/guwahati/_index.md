The busy city of Guwahati, on the banks of the mighty Brahmaputra river, is known for its many mysterious temples. The Kamakhya Temple, the most important shrine in Assam, is dedicated to the goddess Kali. It is an important centre for Tantric Hinduism and Sakti worship. The Navagraha temple is an ancient seat of astrology and astronomy. The Umananda Temple, on an island in the river, is reached by country boat.
