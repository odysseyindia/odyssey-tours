ABN Charaidew I is a heritage river cruise boat from the 1970s that's been completely renovated to provide guests an experience of tasteful riverine living. With 12 AC cabins, the boat is purposefully intimate in size, so guests can rediscover serenity, far from the bustle of life on shore. There is a lovely bar and saloon, a glass-enclosed dining room and a sundeck, all furnished with local handloom fabrics.
