The Eco Camp at Nameri is made up of wood/bamboo cottages and tents, nestled in a clearing in the woods of towering trees. Sunlight filters through the thick canopy of branches overhead and the birdsong is ever present. The Eco Camp offers rafting on the nearby Jia Bhoroli river. The fast-moving river doesn't have too many rapids, but the riverside scenery is wonderful and this is a great way to bird-watch.
