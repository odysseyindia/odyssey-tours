Wild Mahseer's long list of activities starts with a tour of the tea estate and an insight into the process, along with a picnic amid the tea gardens. You can also take a guided tour across its property, forest, and communities nearby, go birding (there are 75 species of birds and 72 species of butterflies in the estate. You can also go cycling, do a cooking lesson that includes tribal recipes, or explore the amazing Eastern Himalayan Botanic Ark, to learn about conservation and local flora and fauna across its 22 acres.
