---






























This tea garden is a true gem. Shaded by gigantic trees, avenues go through the estate. The twelve guest rooms are in 4 separate bungalows, with each room named after some variety of teas grown here in the plantations. There is also a wonderful tea-tasting room. This brightly lit conservatory style room has cheerful white wicker chairs and, with a full house, tea-tasting is held here.
