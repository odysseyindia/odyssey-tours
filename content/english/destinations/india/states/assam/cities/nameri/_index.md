Nameri National Park is home to a rare variety of animals. Unlike Kaziranga's vast open grasslands, Nameri's landscape consists of deciduous forests, which are home to clouded leopards, Indian bison and the rare white-winged wood duck. The Jia Bhoreli river winds through the forests, and you can enjoy white-water rafting trips and jungle walks, which afford excellent birdwatching opportunities.
