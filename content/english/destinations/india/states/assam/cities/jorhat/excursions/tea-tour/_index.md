You have the chance to visit a tea plantation near Jorhat. You can take a walk through the tea gardens, where you may see the tea pickers at work. In the tea factory you'll be able to observe the processes of tea production: withering, rolling, fermenting, drying and sorting. Smelling the aroma of tea throughout this area, you'll understand why Assam is known to produce some of the best tea in the world.
