The best place to stay in Jorhat is Thengal Manor, the colonial-era family home of one of Assam's leading planter families. The architecture with its colonnaded verandah, chandeliered sit-out overlooking lush lawns, fireplace and Louis XV furniture, is an immediate throwback to opulent Raj times. High ceilings, family photos, stately furniture, carpets and the stunning collection of art add atmosphere.
