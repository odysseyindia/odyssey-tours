Jorhat is a major tea hub in Upper Assam, surrounded by many tea estates. The Gymkhana Club, once the centre of social evenings and sports in British days, is still active. Jorhat is a good place to stay if you wish to visit Majuli, the largest river island in the world. The island, a World Heritage Site in the Brahmaputra river, is known for its beautiful rural setting, monastic retreats and traditional tribal architecture.
