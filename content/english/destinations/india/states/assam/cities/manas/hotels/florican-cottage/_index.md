A cluster of small, pleasant cottages owned by a local eco-tourism initiative, Florican Cottage is named after the famous Bengal florican, a type of bustard found in Manas national park. As the name suggests, it's a great base for birders, and it is located right at the periphery of the park, so bird sightings are common, and even larger animals come by from time to time.
