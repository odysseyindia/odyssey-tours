Sikkim is one of India's smallest but most beautiful states, situated in the far north-east of the subcontinent. It is considered to be still one of the last Himalayan `Shangri-las' as a result of its remoteness, spectacular mountain terrain, hundreds of varieties of orchids, and ancient Buddhist monasteries.      Kanchenjunga, the third highest peak in the world, is an awesome presence on the western boundary. Kanchenjunga is worshipped as a god who is the presiding deity of Sikkim.
