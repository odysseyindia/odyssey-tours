Mt. Narsing Village Resort is located 3 km away from Ravangla on the road between Gangtok and Pelling.     Set among quaint villages, it offers a splendid view of the Rangit valley and the surrounding countryside of west and south Sikkim, dotted with ancient and sacred monasteries. The close proximity of the snowcapped peaks of Mt.Narsing, Mt.Jopuno and Mt.Kabur provides a truly magnificent and awe inspiring backdrop.
