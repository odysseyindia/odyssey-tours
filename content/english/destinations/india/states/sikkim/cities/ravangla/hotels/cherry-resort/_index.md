Cherry Resort is located in the Temi Tea Estate, 16 km from Ravangla. The hotel itself is a largely characterless block but the rooms are spacious and the views are unsurpassed as the resort is situated in a truly spectacular location, being totally surrounded by very photogenic tea gardens and mountains. In the morning you can therefore enjoy stunning views of Mt Kanchanjangha and the entire Himalayan range from the roof-top cafe.
