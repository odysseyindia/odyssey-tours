Martam is a small village, situated 25 km from Gangtok and just 5 km from the ancient Rumtek Monastery, in a beautiful setting of rice terraces. Martam is an ideal base for easy walks to nearby villages, an excursion to Rumtek monastery, and for short treks in the vicinity. Mountain bikes are available for hire from the resort.
