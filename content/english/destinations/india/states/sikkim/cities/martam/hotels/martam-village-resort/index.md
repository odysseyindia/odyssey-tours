This small resort overlooks a valley of rich, terraced paddy fields bounded by forest covered hills. The rooms are thatched huts in the traditional Sikkimese village style, simply furnished, with attached modern facilities. All rooms have a large window framing the spectacular views. There is a small dining hall serving Sikkimese food.
