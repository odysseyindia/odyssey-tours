Yuksom is a small village in western Sikkim. It's the kind of place where you can sit on a bench outside a tea-stall, sip tea and gaze at the Himalayan mountains clearly visible in the distance. Yuksom is a well-known starting point for mountaineering expeditions and treks to the higher Kanchenjunga ranges. The famous Dubdi monastery is an hour's trek from Yuksom.
