Located on an upper street in Yuksom, and near the 'king's coronation' stupa, the Tashi Gang Resort is a pleasant two-storey building in the plaster and timber-work style of Sikkimese houses. It has a large lawn in the front, complete with tables and sun umbrellas. The rooms are simple, but comfortable, and are always clean. Traditional rugs and hand-woven cloth brighten the interiors.
