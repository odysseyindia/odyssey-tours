The gold-topped monastery in Tashiding stands on a conical hill between two rivers and can be seen from afar. It is a steep but scenic 2.5km walk from the chortens at the bottom of the village, with tall fluttering prayer flags. The mural work inside is exquisite and there is a large statue of the Buddha. Inside, a pot of holy water, unspoilt for 300 years, is kept sealed and opened only once a year at the Bumchu festival.
