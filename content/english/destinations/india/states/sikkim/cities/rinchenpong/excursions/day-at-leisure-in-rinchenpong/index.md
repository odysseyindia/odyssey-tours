There are a number of trails around Yangsum Farm and Rinchenpong, where hikers get to experience the rich and diverse vegetation of Sikkim. The walks are through villages and forest, and you'll get to see the culture and the unique cultivation methods used here. You can also go on birding walks, along with a member of the family, who are keen birders. You can also learn about the farm itself, and how to make farm-to-table Sikkimese food. All these can be booked directly at the farm.
