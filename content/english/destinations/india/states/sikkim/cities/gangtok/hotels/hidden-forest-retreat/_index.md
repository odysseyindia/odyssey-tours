This small family-run hotel is set amongst three acres of lush green garden planted with many trees, bamboos, ferns, flowers, shrubs, lilies and orchids, which attract a variety of birds and butterflies. There are spectacular views over Gangtok and the surrounding valleys. In the middle of this quiet retreat is a building that offers clean accommodation, with the friendliness of a family-run property.
