It is a winding and bumpy drive to Phodang monastery, a small monastery 40km north of Gangtok, with a serene, timeless atmosphere. Lying on a spur of the hill, it has views of the valley below. Labrang Monastery is 2km uphill from Phodang, and is a small, unusual octagonal structure. You can enjoy the spectacular scenery and views of the Kanchenjunga.
