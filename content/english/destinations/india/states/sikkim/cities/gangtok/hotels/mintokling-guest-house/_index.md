A simple, welcoming homestay on the ridge in Gangtok. The wood-panelled rooms are clean and large, and the building is set amid exotic greenery and pretty lawns. You'll find plenty of options in the restaurant, including genuine Sikkimese food (a must-try), and the staff are helpful and friendly. A good base to explore Sikkim's capital city.
