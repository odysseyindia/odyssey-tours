About 28km from Pelling is the sacred Khecheopalri Lake, a beautiful lake hidden in the middle of dense forest.  According to local legend, the birds don't let even a single leaf to fall into the water. The name Khecheopalri means ' Wishing Lake' and large number of pilgrims come and make wishes all through the year.   From Khecheopalri you can walk part, or all, of the way to Yuksom. The path initially passes through farmland, and then descends steeply through dense forest to cross a small river. After walking for around 2 hours you rejoin the road to Yuksom close to the spectacular Kanchenjunga waterfalls. From here you can drive the last few kilometers to Yuksom, or the more adventurous can continue to walk on a steep uphill path for another 2 hours to reach Yuksom.   Please note that a reasonable standard of fitness is required for this walk, and shoes with a good grip, as the path is steep at times. It should not be attempted during bad weather or after heavy rain, as the path can become slippery and leeches can be a problem. If the walk is not possible, or if you do not wish to walk, you can drive to Yuksom in around an hour.
