Rumtek Monastery is located on a hill opposite Gangtok, 24km away. Rumtek was built in 1740 but had to be rebuilt during the 1960s after an earthquake. Brightly-painted wooden latticework decorates the facade. Inside are beautiful murals and thangka paintings. You are welcome to sit in on the prayer and chanting sessions. They'll even bring you a cup of salted butter tea when it's served to the monks.
