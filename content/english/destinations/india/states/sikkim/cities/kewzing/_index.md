Kewzing is a small market town in central Sikkim, mid way between Pelling and Gangtok, so makes for an ideal place to break up this journey. The villagers here have got together to offer an interesting range of homestay and farmstay accommodation, so as to provide a unique insight into this attractive area, which most tourists simply pass through. Walks can be taken through farmland, and villages, to the small market.
