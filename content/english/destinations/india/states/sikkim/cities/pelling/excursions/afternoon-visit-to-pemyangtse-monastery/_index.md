The awe-inspiring ancient monastery of Pemayangtse, literally 'perfect sublime lotus', is the second-oldest in Sikkim. Traditional frescoes depicting tantrik Buddhist themes adorn the walls, and the highlight is the intricate seven-storey representation of a "Heavenly Palace." Nearby are the ruins of Rabdentse, the second capital of Sikkim, reached by a short path through the surrounding forests.
