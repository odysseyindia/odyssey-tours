The Elgin Mount Pandim is set in eight acres of virgin forest and landscaped gardens. Built in colonial style, it was originally the summer home of the royal family of Sikkim. The elegant guest rooms have shiny wooden floors, silk bedspreads, drapes and Tibetan carpets, with granite and wood-lined bathrooms, and grand views of Kanchenjunga. The 300-year-old Pemayangtse monastery is right by the resort on a verdant hill top.
