Built as meditative retreat, the Norbu Gang House has only 8 rooms in a handsome house.     Their open plan kitchen and traditional style lobby cum salon immediately invokes the feel of being in a true Sikkimese home.     The rooms are built on an extra large scale, all with balconies. There's a beautifully crafted Buddhist altar in their meditation room and the silence of the forest all around the house.
