Norbu Ghang Resort is at the end of the ridge in Upper Pelling, and so offers the best mountain views. The attractive cottages are positioned so as to take full advantage of this location, with superb views from their private balconies. The cottages have walls clad in chatai matting, and tastefully designed interiors in ethnic Sikkimese themes. There is a peaceful garden, an attractive bar, and a restaurant.
