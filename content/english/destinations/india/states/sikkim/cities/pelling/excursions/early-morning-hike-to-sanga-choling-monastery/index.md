  - Early morning hike to Sanga Choling Monastery
---
Early in the morning, your guide will lead you on the 3km hike to Sanga Choling Monastery, perched on top of a hill. It will take you no more than an hour to hike up to the monastery along a narrow path, and it's definitely worth the effort. This is the oldest monastery in Sikkim, giving you magnificent views of the verdant foothills and the imposing mountains behind them.
