Pelling is perched on a ridge, where a number of hotels compete to offer the best views of the Kanchenjunga range of the Himalayas. The view is usually clearest in the early mornings, and is best seen from the nearby hilltop Sanga Chelling Monastery. Pelling is also near the famous monastery of Pemayangtse, where you can see an exceptional collection of religious artworks, and the ruins of Rabdentse, Sikkim's second capital.
