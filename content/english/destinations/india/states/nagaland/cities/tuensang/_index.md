From the town you can walk through the original settlement of Tuensang village, which is spread out along a rough road leading down from the town into the cultivated valley below. There are several well-preserved Chang tribal houses, and a particularly well-preserved morong (dormitory). It is possible to continue walking across the valley floor through the fields and up to another village on the other side of the valley.
