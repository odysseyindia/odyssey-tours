The Heritage is the old District Commissioner's bungalow in the quiet, green, Civil Lines area of central Kohima, so has plenty of old colonial atmosphere.     There are four old-fashioned rooms, with modern paintings indiscriminately added. There is a lounge, a dining area, and an overall feeling of history and relaxation. The two standard rooms are particularly good value, and this is overall the most interesting place to stay in Kohima itself.
