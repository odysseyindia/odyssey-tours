The War Cemetery is on a hilltop in the centre of the city, containing the graves of several thousand allied troops who lost their lives during some of the fiercest fighting during the Second World War. The informative State Museum has exhibits relating to Naga tribal culture, and a small sculpture park. The markets are interesting and sell all sorts of dubious local food stuffs.     The large Hornbill Festival site is at Kisama, 10km from Kohima towards Manipur. There is a Second World War museum here (Rs10 entry fee), a large stone arena where the dances take place during the festival, a smaller arena for evening performances, and 16 Morongs, built in the traditional style of each of the Naga tribes. There is also a food court and a bamboo shopping pavilion, which are open during the festival.
