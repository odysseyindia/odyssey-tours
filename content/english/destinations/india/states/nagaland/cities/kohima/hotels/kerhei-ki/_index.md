Bhoramdeo Jungle Retreat, (BJR), is situated in the north-western Chhattisgarh district of Kawardha. Nestled in the Maikal Hills, Satyendra "Sunny" Upadhyay's farmhouse style home is close to the famous 7th - 11th century Bhoramdeo temple complex.    The Maikal Hills that surround the retreat are home to many species of central India's spectacular wildlife as well as to the indigenous Baigas & Gonds, whose tolas (villages) dot the countryside. The retreat's focus is on real interaction with these gentle tribal people, be that in the tolas themselves, or whilst visiting the many colourful weekly haats (tribal markets).
