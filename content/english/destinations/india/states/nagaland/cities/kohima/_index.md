Nagaland's capital is a pleasant town surrounded by hills. Kohima was the scene of one of the most important, and fiercest, battles during WW2, but is now a friendly city with interesting markets and shops. The bazaar is a good place to meet the Naga people in their colourful woven shawls, who come from surrounding villages to sell their produce. The main sights are the War Cemetery and the State Museum.
