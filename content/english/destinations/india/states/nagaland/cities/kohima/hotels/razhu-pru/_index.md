Razhu Pru is a lovely, quaint homestay in Kohima. The heritage bungalow re are a couple of other places to stay in the town, but this has by the far the nicest atmosphere and feels very relaxed and homely.     The rooms are decently sized, clean and with hot water and good bathrooms. They provide a spectacular  view of the mountains beyond.
