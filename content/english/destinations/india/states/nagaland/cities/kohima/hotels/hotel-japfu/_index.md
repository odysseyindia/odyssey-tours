Hotel Japfu is Kohima's oldest hotel, and it shows. It has a central location and a grand entrance, but no character at all. The 30 rooms are bland, gloomy, and have poor bathrooms. They have balconies, but these have been enclosed and so are ugly. Staff is disinterested. It resembles a poor Government run hotel.
