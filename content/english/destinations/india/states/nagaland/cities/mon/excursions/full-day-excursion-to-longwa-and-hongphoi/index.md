  - Full day excursion to Longwa and Hongphoi
---
Two hours' drive from Mon is the village of Lungwa, situated right on the Myanmar border. In fact, the chief's house is bisected longitudinally by the border. On the way back you visit the village of Hongphoi, which is more off the beaten track and not visited as yet by many outsiders.
