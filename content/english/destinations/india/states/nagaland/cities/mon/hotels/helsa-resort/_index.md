Helsa Resort is 2 km from Mon, just off the start of the road to Lungwa. It is an authentic and atmospheric place to stay with a covered dining area and six traditionally built bamboo cottages overlooking the hills and the town.     The cottages are basic, and have a simple bathroom with hot and cold water provided in buckets. The best aspect is the sit outs with views of the surrounding hills.
