Paramount Guest House is a small hotel in the centre of town. There are six simple en-suite rooms, with cold running water and hot water by buckets. The dining area is upstairs, so is lighter and more appealing.     The food is good, though the service is completely dependent on one young girl who does everything, as the owner is never present. When she leaves in the evenings the owner tells her to padlock the entrance and leave the key at her home nearby, so guests are locked in at night.
