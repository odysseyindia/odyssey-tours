To find semi-traditional Naga villages that are accessible by road, your best bet is to explore the area of the Konyak tribe around Mon, in the northern Naga hills. Just a few decades ago, the Konyaks were still head-hunters and you will still find elderly men with tattooed faces, who would have been involved in traditonal head-hunting at one time. As most Nagas have converted to Christianity, the custom has now been outlawed.
