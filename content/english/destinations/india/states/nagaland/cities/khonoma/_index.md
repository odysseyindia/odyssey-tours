Khonoma is a fascinating village with wooden houses, carved gateway and surrounding stone wall. The village is built around a hill that forms a natural fortress and several key battles in Naga history have taken place here, so there are many memorials. Many aspects of traditional Naga culture remain, from the Morungs (dormitories) to traditional houses, weaving and megaliths.
