Though small, Khonoma Village is fascinating. Many aspects of traditional Naga culture remain here: many of the Morongs are still in use; hunters still live in traditional houses, decorated with hunting trophies; women can be seen weaving; there are megaliths scattered around the village and surrounding fields. There are great views over the rice paddies below the village, and towards the hills beyond. Beyond the village, the forest soon takes over, and it is worth driving a few kilometres into it as mithuns (domesticated bisons) are usually seen here in the clearings.
