Behind the town is Whsipering Winds. This has a few nice rooms upstairs (Executive Deluxe) and some less pleasant, smaller and darker, rooms downstairs. It is friendly and professionally run, but occupies a cramped compound and the current views are about to be lost to a new block of rooms which are under construction, so it completely lacks the sense of space which Metsuben has.
