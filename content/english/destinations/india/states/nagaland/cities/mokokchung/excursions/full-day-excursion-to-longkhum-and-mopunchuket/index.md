  - Full day excursion to Longkhum and Mopunchuket
---
In the morning, you visit Longkhum village, on the highest hill top in the district. It used to be famous for head hunting in the past and the Nagas believe that it is the resting placed for spirits of the dead en route to paradise. You are expected to come again to Longkhum to collect your spirit, which is likely to stay behind. Longkhum commands lovely views and the locals make ethnic handicrafts and handloom products.  Afterwards, you visit Mopunchuket (40 minutes from Mokokchung), a remarkably clean and well-kept village where almost every building seems to have something to do with the Baptist Church. There is a well-preserved Morung (dormitory) of the Ao tribe and a small, well-maintained park with an old totem pole and several more modern wooden sculptures.
