Tuophema Village Lodge is an interesting place, with ten traditional wooden cottages with straw roofs constructed by the village collective which still runs the place. There are also five more cottages with less traditional cement roofs. All have good en-suite bathrooms with hot water geysers.     The lodge has a small outdoor sitting area with views over the hills. The dining room serves good local food.  The home stay can arrange a guide for village walks and evening dance performances.
