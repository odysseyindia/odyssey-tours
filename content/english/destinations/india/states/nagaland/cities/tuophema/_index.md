This is a fairly well-developed village, thanks to the fact that Nagaland's long-serving chief minister is from here. It's well worth an overnight stay, especially during the Sekrenti Festival in February. There is a small museum of tribal artifacts. The village retains many traditional buildings and attractive old gates, many built into trees. You can walk down through the rice paddies, or up into rhododendron forests.
