Nagaland is a narrow strip of mountain territory with a long border with Myanmar to the east.     While Nagaland is mainly known for its green valleys, meandering streams, high mountains and rich variety of flora and fauna, the main attraction of Nagaland is the remote geographical location with 16 different major tribes.     Nagaland offers an opportunity to get a glimpse of a life far removed from ours.
