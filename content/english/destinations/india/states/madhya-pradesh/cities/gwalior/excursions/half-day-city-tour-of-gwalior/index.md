Gwalior Fort, made of sandstone, is a magnificent monument. Within its walls are interesting Jain and Hindu temples and ruined palaces. At the foot of the cliff is an interesting archeological museum and huge Jain sculptures, some up to 20m tall. The Jai Vilas Palace is home to the Scindia family, done in Italian, Tuscan and Corinthian styles. One part is now a museum, with an idiosyncratic collection of royal memorabilia.
