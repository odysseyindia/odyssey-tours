Gwalior lies in the north west of Madhya Pradesh, just 117km south of Agra. Over 1,000 years old, a magnificent hill fort overlooks the town below. The mighty Scindia family once ruled the state of Gwalior, one of the most highly regarded princely states of India, and the old town has their slightly over-the-top 19th-century Jai Vilas Palace. Part of the palace is the present Maharaja's residence; the other is now a museum.
