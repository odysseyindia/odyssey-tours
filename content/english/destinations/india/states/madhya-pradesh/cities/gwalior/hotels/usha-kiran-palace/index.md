An understated and chic offering of the Taj Group of hotels, the Usha Kiran Palace was originally built in the 1930s to welcome the King and Queen of England. As you step into the manicured grounds it is clear that the palace is unique. Luxurious without being overpoweringly opulent, and sophisticated but not snobby, the Usha Kiran Palace will be a highlight of your visit to Gwalior.
