Dhar is a bustling market town, 65km west of Indore. There are excellent views from the ramparts of its hilltop fort of the surrounding countryside, and some beautiful cenotaphs in the old city. The Jhira Bagh Palace in Dhar makes for a good stopover en route to the hill city of Mandu just 33km away, where you can explore the ruins of the beautiful ancient city, once known as the 'City of Joy'.
