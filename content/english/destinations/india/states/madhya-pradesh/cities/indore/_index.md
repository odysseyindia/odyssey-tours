Situated on the banks of rivers Saraswati and Khan, Indore was planned and founded by Rani Ahilya Bai Holkar and derives its name from the 18th-century Indeshwar Temple. The old palaces of the Holkars are worth visiting, particularly the 19th-century Lalbagh Palace. Also of interest in the old city is the 'Kanch Mandir', a Jain temple whose walls are covered entirely with small pieces of different-coloured glass.
