Jhansi's  greatest claim to fame is its fiery queen Rani Laxmibai, who led forces against the British in the 1857 revolt , sacrificing her life to the cause. It is a convenient gateway to Orchha & Khajuraho. A new dimension has been added to  this historic city with the introduction of the Jhansi Festival, held every year in February-March. It offers a fine opportunity to enjoy  the arts, crafts and culture of the region.
