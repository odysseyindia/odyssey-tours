The Coral Country is a cosy six-room homestay a short walk from the Shilpgram parking area (from where you can get eco-friendly transport to the Taj Mahal). With a sweet walled garden, cheerful rooms, large modern bathrooms and an emphasis on cleanliness, good food and friendly service, this is a very pleasant option in Agra.
