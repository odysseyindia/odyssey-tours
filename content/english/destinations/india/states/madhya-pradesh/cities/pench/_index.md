Pench National park, nestling in the lower southern reaches of the Satpura hills is named after the Pench river, which meanders through the park from north to south. It is located on the southern boundary of Madhya Pradesh, bordering Maharashtra. A typical Central Indian teak jungle, Pench supports a rich variety of wildlife, including the tiger, leopard, wild dog, gaur, sambar, chital and brilliant birdlife.
