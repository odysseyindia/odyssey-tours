The park is open from 15 October till 30 June.  We have taken the cost for a safari at Touria Gate. A safari at Khursapar Gate would be slightly more expensive (Rs 500/- per jeep).  All Madhya Pradesh National Parks i.e. Panna, Bandhavgarh, Kanha, Pench, Satpura, Sanjay are closed every Wednesday afternoon for safaris. These parks are also closed on Holi and Diwali festival days.
