This is a rustic resort with wooden huts on stilts, with a well-positioned wooden deck overlooking the jungle, where you can spend the evening gazing at the setting sun giving way to star-sprinkled skies at night. The huts, covered with dried grass to maintain a comfortable temperature inside, come with all essential living amenities, complete with hot and cold running water. The quaint mud and jute restaurant serves great meals, and at night you can enjoy a bonfire and barbeque dinner.
