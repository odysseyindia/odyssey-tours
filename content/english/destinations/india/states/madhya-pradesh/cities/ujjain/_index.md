Ujjain draws visitors mainly for its famous Hindu shrines and the ghats or stone steps that lead down to the Shipra River. Ujjain is one of the four sites to host the Kumbh Mela, the largest religious gathering in the world. Every 12 years, millions of Hindus come together to take a dip in the holy Shipra. However, Ujjain's ghats are worth visiting even when the Kumbh Mela isn't on, a mini Varanasi full of colour and history.
