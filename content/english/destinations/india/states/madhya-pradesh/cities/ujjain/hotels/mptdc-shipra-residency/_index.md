The Madhya Pradesh tourism department's hotel in Ujjain offers simple yet clean and comfortable accommodation.     The hotel is well located, situated within an easy distance of the main sights and the ghats or steps leading down to the holy Shipra River which forms the centre of religious and social life of people in Ujjain.     It is on these ghats that people come to at the start and end of every day to bathe, wash clothes and to perform the sacred rites offering obeisance to the river.
