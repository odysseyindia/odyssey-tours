In the boulder-strewn landscape of the Vindhya mountain range is a collection of 600 rock shelters dating back to the Neolithic Age. Visitors are allowed to venture into 15 of these rock shelters to see cave paintings in bold red, white and yellow depicting animals, hunts and daily scenes in the lives of people during the Stone Age. The UNESCO has acknowledged this treasure by giving it World Cultural Heritage status.
