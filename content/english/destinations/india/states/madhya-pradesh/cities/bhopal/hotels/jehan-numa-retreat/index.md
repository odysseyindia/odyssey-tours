A beautiful resort that feels like a luxury wilderness retreat, while still being within Bhopal. Each large cottage has plenty of privacy, with a sitout and views over the semi-wild grounds (populated with plenty of birds). Once the farm for the local royals, the Retreat still has an extensive organic vegetable garden, and meals are served in different alfresco spots. A great space to relax after days of travel!
