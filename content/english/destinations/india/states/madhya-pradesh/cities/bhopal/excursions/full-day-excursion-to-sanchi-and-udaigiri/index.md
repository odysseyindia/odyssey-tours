Among the oldest surviving monuments of ancient India are the Buddhist stupas of Sanchi, standing dramatically atop a hill. The most famous stupa is encircled by a railing cut by four exquisitely-carved gateways facing the four directions of the compass. The carvings show a world of people and animals living together in happiness and plenty.The Udaigiri Caves are famous for rock-cut sanctuaries, carved into a sandstone hill.
