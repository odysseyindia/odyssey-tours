The Taj-ul-Masjid is one of Indiaâ€™s largest mosques, a huge pink building with massive minarets and domes. The Moti Masjid is architecturally akin to Delhi's Jama Masjid. Bharat Bhawan houses an impressive collection of rural and tribal arts, a modern art and crafts gallery, and more. The Museum of Man is an open-air museum of tribal life, with replicas of adivasi houses, compounds and shrines spread over an entire hillock.
