The Noor-Us-Sabah sprawls in white elegance on a hilltop overlooking Bhopal's lake. Built in the 1920's as a residence for the then princess of Bhopal, this 70 bed-roomed palace was declared to be the 'light of dawn' (Noor-Us-Sabah).     A few turrets rise up into the sky but for the most part the palace is modern, both in its architecture and facilities, which include a pool. However, its indoor spaces are large and opulently furnished, as befitting a palace.
