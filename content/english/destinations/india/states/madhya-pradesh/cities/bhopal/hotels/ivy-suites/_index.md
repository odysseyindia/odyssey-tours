Ivy Suites offers a chance to stay with a modern Indian family in a white, ivy covered villa situated in quiet seclusion in an upmarket residential area of Bhopal.     This home stay promises comfort, a warm and inviting atmosphere and interesting conversation with the hosts, the Sharmas.    With their easy welcoming manner and infectious enthusiasm for their city, it's easy to understand why the Sharmas opened their large home to guests.
