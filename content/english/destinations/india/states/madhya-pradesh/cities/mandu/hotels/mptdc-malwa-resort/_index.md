Mandu's best accommodation offering, the Madhya Pradesh Tourism Department's Malwa Resort has well kept lawns, stand alone cottages and clean rooms.     While it may not have the best atmosphere to enjoy the surroundings, your stay here is certain to be comfortable, with good food and excellent views.     The hotel is set against the backdrop of a water tank belonging to old Mandu and is just a 5 minute walk from the Sagar Talao group of monuments.
