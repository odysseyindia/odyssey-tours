Situated right above the Ken river, this wildlife lodge offers a great jungle experience, whether you're on the wooden restaurant and deck area, built around trees, walking around in the thickly forested grounds, or in the spacious 'huts' that belie their name. These 'huts' feature large, comfortable beds, rustic-looking but efficient bathrooms and even a little terrace at treetop height.
