  - Jeep safari with naturalist in Panna National Park
---
The jeep safaris in Panna take you through the highly varied landscape, through thick, foggy forests and rocky uplands and grasslands that form great birding spots. There are great opportunities for tiger and leopard tracking, but also spots to look for other wildlife, like Vulture Point. Though Panna has a strong tiger population, do not miss the opportunity to learn more about conservation in this forward-thinking park.
