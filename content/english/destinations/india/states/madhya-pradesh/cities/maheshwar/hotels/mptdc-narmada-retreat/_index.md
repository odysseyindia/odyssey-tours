Belonging to the Madhya Pradesh Tourism Development Corporation, the Narmada Retreat is a series of cottages and luxury tents situated on a high bank of the serene Narmada River.     While the hotel and its decor are simple, you are assured of clean, sunny, well appointed rooms, helpful staff and easy access to the sites either by car or boat.
