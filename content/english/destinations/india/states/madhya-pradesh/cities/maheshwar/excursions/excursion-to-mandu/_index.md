The extensive and mainly deserted hilltop fort of Mandu is one of the most evocative sights in central India. Impressive Islamic palaces, mosques and onion-domed mausoleums are spread over a large plateau. The monuments derive from a unique school of Islamic architecture that flourished here in the 15th century. The exotic ruins against the backdrop of beautiful surroundings makes Mandu a lovely place to visit.
