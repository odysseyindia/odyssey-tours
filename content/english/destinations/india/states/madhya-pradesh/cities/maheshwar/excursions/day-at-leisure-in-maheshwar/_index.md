Around the fort, you can explore the Rehwa Society, where weavers continue the age-old art of hand-weaving the beautiful Maheshwari sarees on traditional looms. You can also witness the lovely Lingacharan puja every morning, where priests make thousands of Shiva lingams by hand. Ahilya Fort also arranges various excursions, like picnics, boat rides, a walk around the villages across the river, plus activities like yoga and more. All these can be booked directly at the hotel (a day's notice is preferred for excursions).
