Maheshwar is a small town south of Indore on the banks of the river Narmada, renowned for its Maheshwar saris. The river banks are dotted with colourful shrines and are the site of daily worship of the sacred river. But the most eye-catching structure on the river bank is the 18th-century Ahilya Fort, residence of the erstwhile royal family of Indore, and now converted into a heritage hotel.
