Labboo'z Lodge is an enchanting, quirky little guesthouse within the ramparts of the 18th-century Ahilya Fort. A hotel as whimsical and unpretentious as its name, this cafe offers rooms that are simply yet tastefully decorated with rough white walls and bright furnishings. Relax in the courtyard while you sample the eclectic menu of local fare and Continental favourites such as rosti offered by Labboo'z Cafe.
