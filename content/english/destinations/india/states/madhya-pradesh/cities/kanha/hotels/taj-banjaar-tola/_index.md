A luxurious jungle safari camp, the Taj Banjaar Tola features two campsites, each with its own swimming pool and dining areas. Gorgeous African-style tents, set beside the Banjaar River, offer great comfort in between safaris, with huge bathtubs, wooden decks, and tribal art and metalwork. A sumptuous safari experience.
