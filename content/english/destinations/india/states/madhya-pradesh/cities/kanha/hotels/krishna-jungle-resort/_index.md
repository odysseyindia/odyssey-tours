Just a short distance from the main entrance gate of Kanha National Park, the Krishna Jungle Resort occupies 8 acres of thick forest and provides an ideal setting for bird watching.     There are 17 comfortable and cozy twin bedded rooms, 'home-cooked' food, and an inviting swimming pool. Jungle rides are organized in open jeeps, beginning at 5.30 am in the morning and 2.30 pm in the afternoon.
