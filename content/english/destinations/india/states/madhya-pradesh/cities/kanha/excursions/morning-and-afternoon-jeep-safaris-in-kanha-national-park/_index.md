We organize open jeep safaris in the various zones of Kanha National Park. The naturalist guides know the ecosystem like the back of their hand, and are expert tiger trackers and birders. The morning park excursions begin before dawn, and take around 3 hours. The afternoon jeep safari begins at 3pm and ends at dusk. You can ask for a preferred safari zone, but it's subject to availability.
