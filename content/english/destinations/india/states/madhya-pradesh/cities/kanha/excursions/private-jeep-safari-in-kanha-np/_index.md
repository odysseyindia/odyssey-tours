Kanha's sal and bamboo forests, rolling grasslands and meandering streams stretch over 940 sq km of dramatic natural splendour. Forest guides accompany private jeep rides, which enable visitors to see a good cross-section of Kanha's wildlife, including the tiger. The best areas are the meadows, where blackbuck, chital and barasingha can be seen throughout the day. Less commonly seen are the Indian wild dog and Indian bison.
