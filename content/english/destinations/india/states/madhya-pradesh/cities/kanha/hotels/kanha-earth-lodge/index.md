Kanha Earth Lodge is a luxurious, eco-friendly wildlife resort, tucked in a small hamlet not far from Kanha's Khatiya Gate. The very pleasant, characterful cottages are made from local materials, including waste wood, and offer a nice place to relax in after a game drive, and the cosy common lounge, bar and restaurant (using produce from their organic farm) make it a fun place to stay.
