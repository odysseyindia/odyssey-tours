Rustic cottages perched on the banks of a river. The Wild Chalet has a peaceful and attractive location, with great views over the river and the thickly forested areas. Sightings of wildlife have been reported in close proximity of the resort and birdwatching is also excellent. Your stay is on full board and includes two park rides per day.
