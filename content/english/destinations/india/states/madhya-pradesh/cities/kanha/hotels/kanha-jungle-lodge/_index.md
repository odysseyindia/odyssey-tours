A Jungle Lodge located on acres of sal forests, right on the boundary of the sanctuary. Two rivers flow nearby, making small pools where you have excellent opportunities to observe aquatic birds. There are 15 spacious rooms, built like cottages, simply furnished with all modern amenities including running hot and cold water showers.
