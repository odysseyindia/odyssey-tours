Just outside Barnagar is 'Amla Hertitage Villageâ€™, a quaint little village that seems to be stuck in a time warp. Life here carries on as it must have for centuries, with the odd exception of an electrical flour mill. Amla has been ruled for generations by the family of Raghavendra Singh, who operates the Fort Amla heritage hotel.
