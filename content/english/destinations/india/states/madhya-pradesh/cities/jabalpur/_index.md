Jabalpur was the capital and pleasure resort of the Gond kings during the 12th century. It later fell to the Marathas until the British took it in 1817 and left their mark with cantonment residences and barracks. Today Jabalpur is an important regional centre in the heart of India's forested tribal belt. It is famous for its Marble Rocks, 30m-high white cliffs on either side of the Narmada river.
