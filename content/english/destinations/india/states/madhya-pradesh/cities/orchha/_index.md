In the north of Madhya Pradesh, en route from Agra to the temples of Khajuraho, is the tiny village of Orchha. This medieval town is an architectural gem: during the 16th and 17th centuries this was the capital of the Bundela dynasty, who built a palace on a small river island, followed by other magnificent palaces and temples. It is now a peaceful and easy going place - perfect for relaxation and exploration of the ruins.
