The huge monuments of the Bundela kings surround, and dwarf, the small village of Orchha. The largest is the Palace complex, where the Raj Mahal and Jehangir Mahal boast a unique combination of Hindu & Muslim architecture, with painted decorations and tile work. The Laxmi Temple has more modern artwork. The vast, cathedral-like Chaturbhuj temple and the active Ram Raja Temple in the colourful market area are popular with local worshippers, and the grand cenotaphs  overlook the Betwa River, which is used by the locals for bathing.
