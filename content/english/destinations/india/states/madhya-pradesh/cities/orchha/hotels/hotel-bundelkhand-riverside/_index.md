Built on the same extensive grounds as the old hunting lodge of the Maharaja of Orchha, Bundelkhand Riverside is an atmospheric hotel built on the banks of the Betwa River. The hotel is a two storey structure built and furnished using stone and wood crafted by hand. The historic atmosphere, along with the swimming pool and abundant greenery, compensate greatly for the short 2km drive or riverside walk from the main sights of Orchha.
