Drive from Kajuraho to Panna National Park for a jungle safari. Situated in the Vindhya Hills along the Ken River, Panna National Park hosts lush teak forest and waterfalls, and shelters one of India's most renowned tiger reserves, along with more than 200 other animal and bird species. You explore the wilderness of the park by jeep with your guide, and hope to glimpse of the elusive tigers and other animals in the jungle.
