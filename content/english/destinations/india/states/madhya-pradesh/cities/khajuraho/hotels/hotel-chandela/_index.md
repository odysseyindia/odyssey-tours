Extensive grounds and an abundance of interior space distinguish this hotel from most chain hotels. This low terracotta and white building has a distinctly 1980's feel, and the interiors that have recently been refurbished.     The Chandela has attractive and very comfortable rooms, a swimming pool, an outdoor restaurant and even a tree house where you can enjoy a romantic dinner for two.
