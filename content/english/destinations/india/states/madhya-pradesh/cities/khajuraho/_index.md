Khajuraho, a tiny village in the state of Madhya Pradesh, is world-renowned for the intricately-carved temples - for which there is probably no equivalent in the world - where sculptures celebrate the joy of life and love. Stone figures of celestial maidens appear on every temple. In between are erotic figures running through a whole Kamasutra of positions and possibilities whereby little is left to imagination.
