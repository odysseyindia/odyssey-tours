A short driveway lined by tall bottle palms brings you to Usha Bundela. While the temples of Khajuraho date back to the 9th century, the rest of the town was built in more recent times, as were its hotels, including Usha Bundela, a comfortable old fashioned hotel with a relaxed ambience. Set among large gardens, and featuring a swimming pool this peaceful hotel is within easy distance of the small town of Khajuraho and its famous temples.
