  - Half day tour of Khajuraho temples
---
Of the original eighty five temples, twenty five remain today, with the largest and best preserved, the main Western Group of Temples, in a well-tended garden. The sculptures are sublime and sensuous at the same time. They adorn the temple walls, depicting themes of celestial nymphs, ascetics in penance, hunting and war scenes, group dances and royal processions. It is also worth visiting the smaller eastern Group of Temples, also known as the Jain Temples, which, whilst much smaller, boast some of the most refined stone carving.
