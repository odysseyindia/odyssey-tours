Among the earliest monuments of ancient India that have survived are the Buddhist stupas of Sanchi, standing dramatically atop a hill less than 50km away from Bhopal. The most famous stupa is encircled by a railing cut by four exquisitely carved gateways facing the four directions of the compass.  The carvings show a world where people and animals live together in happiness and plenty.
