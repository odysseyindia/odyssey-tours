There are lots of things to see and do in Kathiwada, which can be arranged at the hotel. You can try hand-block printing at the palace's in-house facility, design and print your own scarf under the tutelage of a master craftsman, or express your creativity at the potter's wheel. Yoga sessions and other activities are also available.       A guided walk though the tribal settlements of Muljhipura and Juna Kathiwada is a must to-do. Visit the local houses decorated with pithora paintings, which are more a ritual than an art form. The age-old Indian tradition of mud architecture is not just sustainable but also versatile. This time-tested building technique has become a reference point for contemporary architects.
