Kathiwada is a village in Madhya Pradesh, just near the Gujarat border and not far from the craft center of Chhota Udepur and the heritage town of Champaner. It houses the Kathiwada Raaj Mahal, a 19th-century mansion which was once the hunting lodge of the Kathiwada royal family. It's been immaculately restored and today offers one of the best heritage-hotel experiences in India.
