The temple town of Omkareshwar is 2 hours' drive from Indore, situated at a spot where the Narmada and the Kaveri rivers meet. On an island between these rivers is the temple of Shiva. It is said that this island is in the shape of the Devnagari letter 'Om'. Clustered around are smaller shrines dedicated to other gods of the Hindu pantheon.
