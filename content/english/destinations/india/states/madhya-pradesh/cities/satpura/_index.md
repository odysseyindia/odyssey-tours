A less-known but extremely scenic national park, Satpura is just three hours from Bhopal, and a great place to simply experience the forest. Apart from the beautiful core zone, known for its leopard sightings, Satpura's main feature is the Denwa river; boat safaris and canoeing are possible, as are night safaris, cycling and walks in the buffer zone, so the experience here goes beyond simply looking for tigers.
