The best way to experience the jungle is to start at the crack of dawn and cross the Denwa River. This is the time when life in the forest slowly wakes up to daylight. Drive in your shared open-top jeep along favoured resting and feeding spots and track the ever-elusive predators of the Satpura jungle.
