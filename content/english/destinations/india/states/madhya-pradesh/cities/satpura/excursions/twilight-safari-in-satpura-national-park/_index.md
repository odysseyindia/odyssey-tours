As enjoyable as it is to watch wildlife in the day, twilight brings a whole new colour to the jungle. The dusk drives in the buffer zone are in collaboration with tribal villages nearby. They reduce tourism pressure in the core area and enable night time patrolling of the forest.  
   
Our naturalist and a designated forest guide expertly navigate the terrain at dusk so you can observe nocturnal animals. In addition to civets, porcupines, owls and nightjars, you stand the chance to see some beautiful beasts by watering holes, quenching their thirst under the cover of night.
