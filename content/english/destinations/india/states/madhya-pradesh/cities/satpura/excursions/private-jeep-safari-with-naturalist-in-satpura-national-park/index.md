  - Private jeep safari with naturalist in Satpura National Park
---
There’s nothing quite like exploring Satpura Tiger Reserve in a private open-top jeep. Accompanied by experienced naturalists and Satpura’s local guides, each ride takes you into heart of the wilderness. In an effort to reduce the pressure of tourism in the area, the authorities restrict the number of vehicles in the reserve, keeping you away from crowds and close to all the action.
