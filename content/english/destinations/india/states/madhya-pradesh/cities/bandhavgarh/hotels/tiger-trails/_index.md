A charming cottage style resort. Tiger Trails has 12 rooms, all with attached bath and hot water. The dining hall overlooks the resort's own private lake which attracts a variety of birds. Elephants also wash here and tigers come to drink in the height of summer. The impressive Bandhavgarh fort can be seen in the distance. Your stay is on full board and includes two park rides per day.
