Bandhavgarh National Park is mainly known for its high density of tigers and its rugged terrain. You might also see ratels, porcupines, civets, the jungle cat, and the striped hyena. Bandhavgarh also has a great number of bird species, and you explore all this on a private jeep safari, escorted by a specialized naturalist.
