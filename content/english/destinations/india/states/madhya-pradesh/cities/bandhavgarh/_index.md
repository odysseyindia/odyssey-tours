Bandhavgarh National Park, dominated by the majestic Bandhavgarh Fort, is one of the best places in India to spot a tiger, and is also home to a wide range of other game such as nilgai, jungle cat, wild boar, hyenas and many species of birdlife. The park is set in rugged terrain with many hills. There are also interesting cave shrines scattered around the park, with Brahmin inscriptions dating from the 1st century BC.
