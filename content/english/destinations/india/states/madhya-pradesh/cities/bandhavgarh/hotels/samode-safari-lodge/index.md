Just as the Samode Palace in Rajasthan is one of the finest heritage places in India, the Samode Safari lodge is a very special jungle lodge. Guest accommodation is in luxurious individual lodges with villas and suites, decorated in tribal motifs. Two main lodges with spacious lounges open onto wooden decks for bird and wildlife sightings.  Zen in a tree-top setting.
