Morning and afternoon shared jeep safaris in Bandhavgarh National Park are escorted by a specialized naturalist for extensive wildlife viewing. Your day begins just before dawn, with tea or coffee. An open jeep takes you into the park to see the majestic tigers. A packed breakfast and water are provided for your 4-hour safari. After lunch, you go for a second game ride into the park.
