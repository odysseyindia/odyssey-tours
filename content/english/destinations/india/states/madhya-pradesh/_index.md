Few regions in India are as fascinating as Madhya Pradesh, the heart of India. Intersected by rivers and dotted with hills and lakes, the state has varied landscapes, each more beautiful than the other.     To the state's north are the famous Khajuraho temples, while eastern Madhya Pradesh has two of India's finest game sanctuaries, Bandhavgarh and Kanha. The scenic Malwa plateau in the southwest has the great Buddhist stupa of Sanchi and the romantic ghost-town of Mandu.
