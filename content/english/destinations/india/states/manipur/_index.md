Manipur, located on the far north east border below Nagaland, has been described it as the Jewel of the East owing to its picturesque hills and valleys. Imphal, the capital, is surrounded by wooded hills and lakes.     Manipur is also home to the Loktak Lake, the largest fresh water lake in the north-east region. Much of it falls within the Keibuk Lamjao National Park. This park has a small population of `dancing deer', the endangered brow-antlered deer.
