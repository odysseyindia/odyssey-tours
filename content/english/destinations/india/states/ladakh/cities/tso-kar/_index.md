Tso Kar is the smallest of the three major lakes in Ladakh. It is also called 'White Lake' because of the white salt deposits on the lake shores. Surrounded by hills and mountains, the lake provides wonderful views. Tso Kar lake is surrounded by marshlands that host amazing bird-life, including the famous black-necked cranes, and the hills are home to kiangs, the largest of the wild asses, ibex, snow foxes and snow leopards.
