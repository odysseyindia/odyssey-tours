Tso Kar Lake is bordered by lofty mountains that are home to the elusive snow leopard. Apart from just the stunning scenery, the area is rife with wildlife and flora, and is great spot for birders, especially during migration season when several species come here to lay their eggs, including black-necked cranes. The most easily spotted mammals here are kiangs, the largest of the wild asses, and you might also see ibex and snow foxes. The local inhabits are the Khampas, a nomadic group that live in large tents in summers, and in solid stone huts to brave the winter.
