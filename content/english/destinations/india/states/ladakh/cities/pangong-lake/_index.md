Ladakh offers its visitors some rare sights like the magical, 130km-long Pangong Lake, lying at 4,267m and partly in China. The spectacular view of the Changchenmo range of mountains reflects itself in the ever changing blues and greens of the lake. Walk along the shores of the lake and enjoy the tranquility of these peaceful surroundings.
