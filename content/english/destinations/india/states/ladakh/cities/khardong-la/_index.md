The spectacular drive from Leh to the Nubra Valley crosses the Khardong La (5602m), the world's highest motorable mountain pass. From the pass, one can see all the way south over the Indus valley to the seemingly endless peaks and ridges of the Zanskar range, and north to the giants of the Saser massif. The villages in the Nubra Valley (meaning green) are irrigated and fertile, producing wheat, barley, peas, mustard for oil, and a variety of fruits and nuts, including apple, walnut, apricot and even a few almond trees.
