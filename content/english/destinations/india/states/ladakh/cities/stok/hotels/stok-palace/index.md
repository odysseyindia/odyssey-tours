Stok Palace, belonging to the royal Namgyal family, is part of Ladakh's cultural heritage. The 200-year-old mural-adorned walls, the Buddhist chants, a traditional Ladakhi meal under apricot and walnut trees, are the Ladakhi way of life. Perched on a hill, the building is stately outside and mysterious inside, with shaded corridors and courtyards, and richly-decorated suites.
