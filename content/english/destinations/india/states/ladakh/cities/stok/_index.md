Across the valley from Leh, Stok's main drawcards are its 14th century Buddhist monastery with ancient paintings and a library with Buddha’s teachings, its collection of traditional Ladakhi houses, and a 19th-century royal palace.  Descendants of the royal family still reside in the palace and part of it has now been converted into a heritage hotel. The museum within the palace exhibits artifacts which enlighten visitors about the life of the Ladakh royals, their history, currency and weapons. The palace has a pleasant café, offering fine terrace views.
