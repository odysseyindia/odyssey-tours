When you choose to stay at Stok Palace you are choosing to immerse yourself in the cultural heritage of Ladakh. The 200 year old mural adorned walls, the sound of Buddhist chants from the palace temple or a traditional Ladakhi meal in the royal kitchen, even evening tea in the shade of the magnificent old apricot and walnut trees, all are a part of the experience of the Ladakhi way of life.    Guests staying at the Stok Palace Heritage Hotel have privileged access to a Buddhist temple on the upper-most floor of the palace. The resident monk here performs daily prayers and rituals as part of his duties. Guests are welcome to be quiet observers to this enchanting routine.    Near the palace is the 14th century Stok Gompa. Though some of the 550 year old original construction remains, the monastery’s main assembly hall is relatively recent – it was renovated about 50 years ago, and freshly painted with murals. A throne in this hall is reserved for the Dalai Lama. The monastery has a notable library including a collection of the Buddha's own teachings in their Tibetan translation. Next to the monastery is the 71 feet (22 m) high seated Gautama Buddha statue and temple, consecrated by the 14th Dalai Lama in 2016.
