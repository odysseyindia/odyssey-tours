The Kang La Chen is set amongst lawns, a stone's throw away from the shops, restaurants and the local fruit market of the Main Bazaar Road. A simple two-storey building built in the style of traditional Ladakhi homes, this hotel is popular throughout Leh's short season and fills up early. The uncluttered rooms are pine-floored and overlook the front lawn.
