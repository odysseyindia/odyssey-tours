Shey is the oldest of the three monasteries near Leh, and is not in regular use. The monastery contains a two-storey-high statue of the Buddha seated in meditation. Up ahead is the twelve-storey, 800-year-old Thikse Gompa, a good place to witness religious ceremonies. It's a magical moment when the monks say their prayers amidst mystical chanting, the ringing of bells, the clashing of cymbals, and the blowing of horns.
