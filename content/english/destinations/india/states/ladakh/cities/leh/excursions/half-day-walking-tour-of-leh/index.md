  - Half day walking tour of Leh
---
The best way to see Leh is on a walking tour. Along the main street the Buddhist women with their tall hats chatter freely as they sell vegetables. Narrow lanes veer up through the old city; you pass old dwellings clustered on the slope and end up at the 16th-century Leh Khar Palace and its gompa, the Temple of the Guardian Deities, on top of the hill. Though ruined and austere, Leh Palace still makes an unforgettable backdrop to the mud city.
