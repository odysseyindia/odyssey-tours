Leh is Ladakh's principal town. It used to be one of the busiest market towns on the caravan trade between India and Central Asia. These days it retains a distinctly central Asian feel. Leh is dominated by the nine-storey Palace, a building in the grand tradition of Tibetan architecture, and is said to have inspired the famous Potala in Lhasa, which was built half a century later.
