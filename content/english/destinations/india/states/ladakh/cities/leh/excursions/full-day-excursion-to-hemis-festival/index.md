  - Full day excursion to Hemis festival
---
The Hemis monastery is the biggest and wealthiest in Ladakh. Colourful flags flutter from the four pillars in the courtyard. This is the stage for the famous Hemis festival at the end of June, which celebrates the birth anniversary of Guru Padmasambhava. Locals are seen dressed up in their finest traditional garb for the occasion. Lamas called 'chhams' perform splendid masked dances and sacred plays to the accompaniment of cymbals, drums and long horns. The head lama presides over the function.
