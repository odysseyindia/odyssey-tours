Shey is the oldest of the three monasteries near Leh, and is not in regular use. The monastery contains a two-storey-high statue of the Buddha seated in meditation. Up ahead is the twelve-storey, 800-year-old Thiksey Gompa, a good place to witness religious ceremonies. It's a magical moment when the monks say their prayers amidst mystical chanting, the ringing of bells, the clashing of cymbals, and the blowing of horns. The Hemis monastery is the biggest and wealthiest monastery in Ladakh.  Colourful flags flutter in the breeze from the four pillars in the courtyard.
