Kyagar (also called Tegar) is a village along the Nubra River, halfway along the road to Panamik. Panamik was known for centuries for its hot springs and as a stop along the ancient trade route to China. Above the village is the 19th-century Samsanling Gompa, a large complex of seven temples. A monk is usually available to open the prayer rooms, which house an impressive collection of thangkas and well-restored frescoes.
