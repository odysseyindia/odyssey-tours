Lchang Nang Retreat is set amidst an orchard of elm, apricot, and apple trees, with the Siachen river rushing past its western boundary. The cottages, created in the local architectural style using mud, stone and poplar, all have a private garden and sit-out. The restaurant provides a wide array of dishes, and even spa treatments are available here, amid gorgeous views of the snow-capped Himalayas.
