Today you visit the Samstanling Gompa, situated in a peaceful location overlooking the green fields of Sumur village. Parts of the 19th-century monastery have been recently restored, and feature impressive images. The sacred Yarab Tso is popularly known as the hidden lake. From the road, there is a short 15-minute walk to the shore of the beautiful lake, a great place for a picnic lunch. You then continue to Panamik. This was a major halt on the caravan trade route, and is now well known for its medicinal hot springs.
