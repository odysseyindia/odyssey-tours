North of Leh, the Nubra Valley is a sublime mixture of cultivated fields set in an arid desert that glows with white sand surrounded by the Karakoram Range and sliced by rivers. After crossing the Khardungla Pass, you descend to the villages of Nubra, which were important stops for rations along the Silk Road to Central Asia. You find here the rare double-humped Bactrian camels once used for transport on the Silk Road.    The villages in the Nubra (meaning green) Valley are irrigated and fertile, producing wheat, barley, peas, mustard for oil, and a variety of fruits and nuts, including apple, walnut, apricot and even a few almond trees.     Hundar was the capital of the erstwhile Nubra kingdom in the 17th century, and is home to the ruined Chamba Gompa. In nearby Deskit, you can visit the 15th-century monastery. This is the most important monastery in the Nubra Valley, and the rooms are full of thangka paintings, statues and effigies of the Buddha, and old murals.     Before the partition of India and Pakistan, the Nubra Valley was a centre for trade, as the famous Silk Route passed through this area. Every year, over 10,000 pack animals - horses, yaks, Bactrian camels, and an especially sturdy breed of local sheep - traversed the Nubra region, carrying Varanasi brocades, Chinese silks, pearls, spices, Indian tea, pashmina wool, salt, indigo, opium, carpets, and gold.     Between Hundar and Diskit lie several kilometres of sand dunes, and Bactrian camels graze in the "forests" of seabuckthorn. You have a unique opportunity to ride a Bactrian camel amidst the sand dunes of this high-altitude desert, with snow-capped mountains on the horizon.
