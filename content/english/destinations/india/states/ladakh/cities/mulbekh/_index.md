A pretty village 40km east of Kargil, Mulbekh is the point where the Buddhist influence starts. The village has a mixed population of Buddhists and Muslims, and supports a mosque as well as a monastery, perched on a crag above the village. The main attraction of Mulbekh is a giant engraving of Maitreya, the Future Buddha. It is believed that the 9m-high statue, carved out of solid rock, was built in the 7th or 8th century.
