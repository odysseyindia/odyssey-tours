This guesthouse offers the Mulbekh's smartest accommodation with modern tiled floors and turned wooden banisters. Having said this, the rooms are small and basic and hot water for bathing will be delivered to you in a bucket shortly after you arrive.    This is a typical local guesthouse, with the children of the owners playing outside and sometimes interacting with you. Food is served in the small but nicely done dining hall on the first floor.
