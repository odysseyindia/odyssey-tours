After the division of Ladakh in the 14th and 15th centuries, the lower kingdom was controlled largely from this village. Themisgaam was also the scene of a treaty that secured a Ladakhi monopoly on Tibetan 'pashmina', the valuable wool made from a goat's beard. The castle is now in ruins, but the Gompa still stands high on a hill above town, a good vantage point over the rather miraculous Ladakhi farms.
