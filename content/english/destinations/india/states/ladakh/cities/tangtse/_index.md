Tangtse is a small village surrounded by mountains, with a small tributary of the Indus River passing through it. This village is best known for its small but charming monastery, home to the venerated 'talking statue' of Kyoba Rimpoche. Built into a rock-cleft beneath a fortress ruin, the monastery is almost invisible from the main road.
