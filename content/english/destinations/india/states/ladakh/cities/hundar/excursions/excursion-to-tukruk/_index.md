Full-day excursion to Turtuk (approx 3 hours drive from Hundar). Turtuk is as close as you can get to Pakistan in India. This delightful village is crunched into the narrowing Shyok River valley, well off the beaten track. Turtuk is a treat - culturally intact, untainted by tourism and simply delightful. The Muslim Balti inhabitants are exceptionally friendly, and this area offers excellent opportunities for photography.
