Surrounded by barren hills, with the backdrop of beautiful snow-covered mountains, Tso Moriri Lake is a spectacular sight, with deepl blue, crystal-clear water. This serene lake and the area around it attract a large range of wildlife, including migratory birds, marmots, wild asses, and (rarely-spotted) Tibetan wolves. Nomadic herders of goats, yaks, and cows live in the lake's vicinity.
