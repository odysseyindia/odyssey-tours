Nestled in the Changthang Valley, this 28-km-long pristine waterbody is also called Mountain Lake as it is surrounded by a number of tall peaks. The calm, sacred lake has now been named a wetland reserve, and you can see the bare-headed goose, great-crested grebe, Brahmin duck and brown-headed gulls. You can also spot some bharal or blue sheep, marmots, Tibetan sheep, red fox and kiang or Tibetan ass, and if you're very lucky, the Tibetan wolf.
