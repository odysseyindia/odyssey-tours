Tiny Tripura, almost surrounded by Bangladesh, is the second smallest state in India. Heavily forested, it's renowned for its vast array of bamboo products. Handloom weaving is also a significant industry there.     Agartala, the state capital, is a laid-back city from where there are convenient day trips to the former royal capital of Udaipur, 52 km to the north of Agartala, and the fairy-tale water palace at Neermahal, 55 km south of Agartala.
