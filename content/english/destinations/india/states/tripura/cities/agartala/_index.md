Agartala is Tripura's low-key capital, just 2 km away from the border of Bangladesh. Itâ€™s a congested but relaxed place, and in many ways seems more like a small town than a state capital. The pace of life is unhurried and the people are extremely friendly. The mixed European-Mughal style Ujjayanta Palace stands amidst large well-kept 'Mughal' gardens with pools and floodlit musical fountains.
