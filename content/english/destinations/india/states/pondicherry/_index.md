The Union Territory of Pondicherry comprises four coastal regions: Pondicherry and Karaikal, situated on the east coast of Tamil Nadu, Yanam in Andra Pradesh and Mahe on the west coast of Kerala. Pondicherry is the capital of this Union Territory.    Pondicherry has a unique ambience, unlike any place else in India. It is a blend of spiritual aura, French colonial heritage, Tamil culture, and the cosmopolitan flair of hosting many nationalities in a small but varied town.
