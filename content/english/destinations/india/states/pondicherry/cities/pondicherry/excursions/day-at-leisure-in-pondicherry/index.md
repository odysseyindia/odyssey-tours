Pondicherry is a wonderful place to explore on your own. The French Colonial section, or White Town, is a delight on foot, with pastel-coloured buildings under beautiful trees, a breezy promenade to cool off in, and plenty of quirky shops and cafes to stop at. The grid-like layout makes White Town easy to explore, too.    A short drive outside Pondicherry is the spiritual, alternate-living city of Auroville. A fascinating set-up, the city is divided into sectors for living, relaxation and types of work. It is explored easily on foot, on cycle or in an electric vehicle (available at the Visitor Centre). There are also pleasant shops and cafes and lovely tree-lined areas to sit in. Please note: if you wish to visit the golden dome, you have to visit Auroville, register, and return two days later.
