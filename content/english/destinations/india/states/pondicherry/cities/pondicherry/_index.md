Pondicherry (or Puducherry) is best explored on foot. One can experience the colonial charm of the town by walking through its old quarter, which houses a varied collection of buildings, churches, homes and markets and thoroughfares with French names. You can also visit nearby Auroville, an interesting experiment in alternative living, with a very informative Visitors' Centre, and nice cafes and shops.
