A new, airy hotel in Madurai, known for its spacious rooms, pleasantly decorated with wood carvings, and for the art that lines practically every wall. There's even an audio-guide tour of the hotel, with a downloadable app that tells you the history of Madurai through a number of sketches and paintings.     There is a pleasant pool and a choice between the multi-cuisine restaurant on the ground floor and a specialty South Indian one on the rooftop terrace. A very comfortable stay option in Madurai.
