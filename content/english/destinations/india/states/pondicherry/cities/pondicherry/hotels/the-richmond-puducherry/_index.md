The Richmond Puducherry is a small boutique hotel with 14 well-appointed rooms. The Richmond is located in the French colonial quarter on Pondicherry, just 2 minutes walk from the Promenade Beach. You can explore the French Town by literally walking down the lanes of history. Be it the grand colonial houses of the French in "White Town" with their yellow, pink or white frontage, or the "Ashram Town" easily distinguished by its grey and white buildings or lastly the Tamil and Muslim quarters, each with its unique signature as architecture is concerned.
