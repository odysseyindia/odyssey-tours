A chic, modern, boutique-style hotel overlooking the Bay of Bengal. the Bay of Bengal. The towns ancient French quarter - with its colonial villas - leafy parks and attractive cafes - are just a block away.    The rooms are simple sophistication. Blank white walls and large amounts of sunlight ensure that the rooms are filled with zingy light to which the wood paneling and floor add dollops of warmth.     Eat outside on the roof while watching the waves play in the dying light or dine in the formal indoor restaurant. Their relaxed, low tabled lounge bar is where you head for a sundowner cocktail or a night cap.
