Situated in the heart of the old `Ville Blanche' (white town) of French Pondicherry, at 5 Rue de la Caserne, is one of India's most striking designer hotels. Constructed in the 18th century as the residence of the Mayor of Pondicherry, the building stands white and majestic, just a few blocks from the promenade and a leafy park. Le Dupleix is elegant and luxurious, with beautiful woodwork, a very inviting bar and a grand air.
