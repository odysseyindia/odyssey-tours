Hotel de l'Orient is a large terracotta-pink and white villa. Originally built in the 1760s, the house has been expertly restored to retain much of its original paint and plaster, its shiny red oxide floors, and its high louvered wooden doors and windows. Exquisite objects d'art, aquarelles and lithographs are found throughout - this is as close as you will come to re-living the magnificence of French Pondicherry.
