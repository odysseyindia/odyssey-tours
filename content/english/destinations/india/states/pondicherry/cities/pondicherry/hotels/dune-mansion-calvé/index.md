Dune Mansion Calvé Heritage Hotel is a 150-year-old Tamil mansion with influences of French and baroque architecture and is located on Vysial Street, which was renovated by UNESCO as a model of a heritage street of Franco-Tamil architecture. Very different from the French colonial houses of Pondicherry, the Mansion Calve has gleaming wooden pillars, a central atrium and a unique feel closer to the huge mansions of Chettinad.
