Palais de Mahe is located in the heart of the French Quarter, a few steps away from the famed Promenade. The rooms are high-ceilinged, spacious and uncluttered. Fine period-inspired furnishings provide just the right finishing touch. There is an inviting plunge pool in the courtyard, and an Ayurvedic massage and treatment centre. The restaurants whip up French delicacies, Continental fare and local cuisine with equal ease.
