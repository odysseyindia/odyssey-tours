A 19th-century mansion, first set up as a women’s clinic, Villa Helena is now is a very charming little guest-house, just 300 metres from the sea in Pondicherry’s White Town. The white-painted rooms are around the shaded main courtyard (now a café and restaurant) and around a smaller, very cute courtyard behind. There is also a massage room if you need to relax after walking around Pondy’s lovely streets.
