Nagarjuna Sagar, known as Vijayapuri in ancient times, is an important Buddhist site, 155km from Hyderabad. Here in the shadows of the tallest masonry dam in the world are the excavated ruins of a lost centre of Buddhist learning and culture, preserved on an island in the lake. The museum houses a stupendous collection of Buddhist art and culture. A short distance away is Anupu, another Buddhist archaeological site.
