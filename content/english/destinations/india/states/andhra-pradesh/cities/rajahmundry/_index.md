Rajahmundry is a city on the east coast of India, roughly halfway between the better known cities of Vijayawada and Vishakapatnam.  Although Rajahmundry is a good eighty kilometres from the coast, the Godavari, India second largest and holiest river, is so wide at this point that it takes five to ten minutes to cross by road or train. This area is lined with all sorts of temples, shrines and bathing ghats, making it a splendid spot to take in Hindu practices at work.
