Tirupati is at the bottom of the 'holy hill' of Tirumala, approximately 140km north of Chennai, one of the most important pilgrimage centres in India. On top of the hill, the Shri Venkateshvara temple is said to be the richest and most popular place of pilgrimage in the world, drawing more devotees than Rome or Mecca, and one of the few places that allows non-Hindus into the sanctum.
