Today, you have a pleasant 4-5 hour walking round trip from Thikalna (at your own pace), exploring the nearby villages and woodland, complete with a picnic lunch. Sights on the trail include villages buzzing with little children, people farming their fields, elderly men enjoying their hookah over tea, cattle grazing, and the elegant magpie and much more.
