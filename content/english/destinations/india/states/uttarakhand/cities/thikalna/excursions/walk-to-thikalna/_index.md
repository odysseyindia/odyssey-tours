Today,after driving from Bhimtal to the market town of Almora, you can spend some time exploring this ancient hill town, and visit the temple of Golu Devta, the god of justice, just outside the town. The temple, unusually, is full of brass bells, hung up as offerings by devotees.    


You then limber up for your walking tour with a 1-hour stroll through oak and rhododendron forests to the village of Thikalna.
