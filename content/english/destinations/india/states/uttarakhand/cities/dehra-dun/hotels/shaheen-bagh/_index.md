Nestled in the Doon Valley on the banks of the Tons River is Shaheen Bagh, the country home of an avid ornithologist and graphic designer.     The house, with an adjoining cottage, is located on a 7-acre estate verdant with fruit orchards, and many species of exotic and rare plants and trees.     The house and the adjacent cottage are designed in the style of a colonial country bungalow with sloping roofs, decorative 'monkey tops' and wide verandahs from where one can enjoy spectacular views of Mussoorie and the surrounding hills.
