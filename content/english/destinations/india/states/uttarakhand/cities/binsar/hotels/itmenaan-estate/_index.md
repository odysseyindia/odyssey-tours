Itmenaan Estate is a fairytale resort near Binsar, one of the most beautiful spots in the Kumaon Himalayas. The 10-acre resort includes virgin pine, oak and rhododendron trees and even a little natural spring. This restored 100-year-old house offers panoramic views of the Himalayas including the majestic Nanda Devi, and plenty of pleasant walks around - or just a delightful place to put your feet up and enjoy Kumaoni hospitality.
