The birding walk at Mary Budden is called Hodgson's Trail, in homage to Brian Houghton Hodgson, who served as the Assistant Commissioner in Kumaon in the early 19th century and whose seminal work was to identify a vast variety of birds in the Himalayas. Walk through the forest with a naturalist, in gentle pursuit of the nearly 179 different species of birds found specifically in the forests of Binsar, tracing the paths taken by Mr. Hodgson.
