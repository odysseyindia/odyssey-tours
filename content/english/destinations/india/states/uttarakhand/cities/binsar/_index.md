The Binsar Valley is located in the Nanda Devi range of the Kumaon Himalayas, which are on the border between India & Nepal. Most visitors come for the 300-kilometre panorama of Himalayan peaks, and to visit the storied hill villages. Its location offers stunning views and makes the Binsar Valley a good base for bird-watching and walks through the beautiful pine and deodar woods.
