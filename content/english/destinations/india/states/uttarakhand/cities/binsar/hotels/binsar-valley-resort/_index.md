The Binsar Valley Resort was established in 1934 as a private residence. The original building was renovated and 9 new cottageswere added in 1990. The cottages are comfortably furnished with all mod-cons. The lounge and the dining room are made cozy with fire-places in the evenings. Much of the food prepared in the family run kitchen is grown nearby whilst the bread is freshly baked.
