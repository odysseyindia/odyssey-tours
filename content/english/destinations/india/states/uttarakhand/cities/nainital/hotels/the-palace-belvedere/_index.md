The former summer palace of the Rajas of Awagarh is now run as a heritage hotel under the personal supervision of the present royal family . Built in the late 19th century, the palace has 18 spacious rooms and suites, all resplendent in an old-world charm. The hotel offers a panoramic view of the famous Naini Lake.
