Set around a small lake, this charming hill town has quaint cottages with well-kept lawns on steep, tree-covered hillsides. Most of the activity around the lake takes place along the Mall, a 1.5km-long promenade. There are boating facilities on the lake. You can also take a horse ride or walk up to the 2,600m China peak in the early morning for fine views over the town and the snow-clad Himalayas.
