The Naini Retreat is one of the finest hotels in Nainital. Once the residence of the Maharaja of Pilbhit, it is an aristocratic building with a peaceful and soothing ambience. Beautifully situated high above the lake, with extensive and immaculate grounds, the hotel's rooms have tasteful furnishings. The dining room offers lovely views of the Alpine scenery.
