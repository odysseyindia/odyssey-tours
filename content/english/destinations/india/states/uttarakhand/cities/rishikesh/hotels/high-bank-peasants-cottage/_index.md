Situated midway between the twin bridges of Rishikesh, the High Bank Peasant's Cottage is a comfortable and unpretentious guest house.     Housing only a handful of rooms and surrounded by residences, the hotel offers clean, well kept rooms that are good value for money.     The rooftop restaurant overlooks the serene Ganges and is the perfect spot for breakfast. The staff is friendly and welcoming and the hotel also offers ayurvedic oil massages.
