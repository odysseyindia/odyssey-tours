Spirituality is an integral part of the culture of Rishikesh. You’ll find temples at every corner of the city and there are many ashrams offering courses on meditation, yoga and Hindu philosophy. You can also take a tour of the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi Ashram where The Beatles composed 40 songs in 3 weeks in 1968     The narrow streets of Rishikesh are full with colourful shops selling a variety of items ranging from handlooms to travel bags to traditional clothing.  Plenty of cafes have sprung up around the city where you can sip on a hot coffee and watch the world go by.    In the evening worshippers congregate for the `Ganga Aarti’ with ‘diyas’ (earthen lamps), garlands and chanting of mantras (ancient sacred texts), a fascinating spectacle to watch.
