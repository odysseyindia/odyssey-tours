A labour of love for Steve Dunjey and his architect wife Trupti, the Rainforest House is a small boutique guesthouse on the banks of the grey waters of the Ganges.     They have created a property that disturbed very little of the intrinsic beauty of their forested piece of land, bordered by the Shivalik hills on one side and the swiftly flowing Ganges on the other.     The rooms use forest colours of deep green and brown and have a rustic charm.
