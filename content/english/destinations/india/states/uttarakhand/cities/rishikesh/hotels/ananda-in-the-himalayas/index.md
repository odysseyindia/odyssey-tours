A luxurious spa resort built around a Maharaja's palace near Rishikesh. The rooms and suites have a fabulous location overlooking either the valleys of the Ganges below or the palace gardens. Located in the purer airs of the hills of Rishikesh, the spa offers not only a multitude of healing and beauty experiences and wellness rituals, but also "spa meals" custom designed to suit your body type all of which are based on the ancient principles of ayurveda. The accommodation is also designed as a part of the holistic rejuvenation that Ananda provides and the rooms are all quietly tasteful, uncluttered and open to the outdoors.
