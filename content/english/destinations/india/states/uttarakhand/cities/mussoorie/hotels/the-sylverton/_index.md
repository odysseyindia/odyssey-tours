Camping along  Pangong lake has been banned so for now we will keep Tangtse as the base . This is 1 hour short of Pangong lake . People can drive to Tangtse, spend time at the lake and return to Tangste for the night or drive leisurely to Tangtse and the following early morning, visit the lake, spend time and return to Leh.
