This hill station, with its misty hills and diverse flora, offers some excellent walks. The most famous, the 'Camel's Back Road', takes its name from a rocky outcrop in the shape of a camel's hump. The road passes a beautiful cemetery.    Gun Hill is where cannon used to be fired at noon every day, and can be reached via a cable car starting from the Mall. Kempty Falls and the Company Garden with its display of flowers is an attractive spot. In Happy Valley, you will come across the first Tibetan temple built by the Tibetan refugees.
