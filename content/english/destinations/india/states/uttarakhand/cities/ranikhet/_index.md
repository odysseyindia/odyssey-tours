The thick forests of Ranikhet (1824m) were discovered by the British, in the late 1860s, when they were looking for an army base. The tranquil green meadows surrounded by pine and oak forests, with a panoramic view of the Kumaon Himalaya, provided ideal environs for Tudor style bungalows, churches, a country club, a golf course and a full-fledged army regiment. Today, new construction is confined to the bazaar area while the rest of the town above it retains itâ€™s peacefully atmosphere with plenty of forest trails leading to the crest of the hill.
