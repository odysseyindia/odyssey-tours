Don't expect luxury here. The cottages are spacious but very simple are this is a retreat in a remote part of the country. Individual Sit outs, attached bathrooms, fireplaces make the stay warm and comfortable.    Simple and wholesome Indian and continental meals are served at the thatched dining area. Barbeque and bonfire add an old world charm to winter evenings. The retreat also houses a small library well equipped with nature and travel publications.
