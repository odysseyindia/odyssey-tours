Rajaji National Park is most famous for the large herds of wild elephants that live in its wooded forests and for the mountain goat, the 'goral'. The main predators are tigers and leopards who are drawn to the numerous spotted deer, or 'chital'. The park is also home to some 300 bird species. A lesser-known park, Rajaji is at an easy distance from both Haridwar and Rishikesh. The park is open from 15th Nov to 30th June.
