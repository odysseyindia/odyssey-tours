Gangotri is a town in the state of Uttarakhand, nestled in the midst of the foothills of the Himalayas.  It is a Hindu pilgrim town on the banks of the river Bhagirathi and origin of river Ganges. The 18th century granite temple here is dedicated to the goddess Ganga, where she is believed to have descended to earth. Hindus believe that Ganga (here Bhagirathi) came down from heaven after King Bhagirathiâ€™s centuries-long penance.
