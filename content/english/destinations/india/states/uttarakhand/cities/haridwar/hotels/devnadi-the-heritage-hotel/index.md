A wonderfully-restored art-deco mansion that once belonged to a princess of Nepal, this is now a small hotel, right on the banks of the Ganges, and a short walk away from Har Ki Pauri, the main ceremonial area. The rooms are highly atmospheric and high-ceilinged, with great views over the river. The hotel has a private bathing ghat, at which they conduct their own aarti ceremony every evening.
