Promenades, river channels and bridges create a pleasant riverfront ambience, with the major ghats and religious activities clustered around Har-ki-Pauri. Non-Hindus are not allowed onto this ghat, but the island opposite it, topped by a clock tower, provides an excellent vantage point.     


At dusk, the spectacular daily aarti ceremony is performed, drawing a crowd of thousands onto the islands and ridges. Candles on lotus petals are floated down the river, and priests perform rituals, swinging torches to the accompaniment of gongs and music.
