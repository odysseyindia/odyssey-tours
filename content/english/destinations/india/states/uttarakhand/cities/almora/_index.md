A picturesque mountain resort, Almora is also the cultural capital of the region, perched at an elevation of 5400 ft in the Kumaon Hills, atop a ridge mentioned in ancient scriptures. While it is bordered by gentle hills on three sides, its northern front affords a breathtaking view of the Trishul peaks. Sunrise offers a particularly beautiful view of the Greater Himalayas.
