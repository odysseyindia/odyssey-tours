A quaint village (1,940m), which lies about 35 kilometres east of Almora town. It is about an hoursâ€™ hike from Jageshwar temples, believed to have been constructed between the 8th century and the 18th century. The architecture belongs to the Nagara style of North India, characterized by a tall curved spire surmounted by an amalaka (capstone) and a kalasha crown.
