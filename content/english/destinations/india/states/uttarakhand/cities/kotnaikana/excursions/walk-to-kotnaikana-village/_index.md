After a leisurely breakfast, walk along the ridge towards Saukiyathal temple and Jageshwar temple complex with beautiful views of the Nanda Devi range on your left. Nearing Jageshwar in a valley you will notice the pine forest now change to thick deodar (cedar). The temples at Jageshwar are believed to have been constructed between the 8th and 18th centuries.    You'll have a picnic lunch after visiting the temples, and then carry on through pleasant forests to the villages of Kotnaikana, where you stay the night. You also have a 15-minute walk later to a sunset point near the house. You can spend the evening by a bonfire.
