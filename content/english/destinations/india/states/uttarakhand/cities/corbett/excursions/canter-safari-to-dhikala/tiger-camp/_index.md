The canter safari to Dhikala only operates from 15 Nov to 15 May                There are 2 safaris that can be taken in a day -       Morning safari - from 6 to 10 AM.       Afternoon safari - from 2 to 6 PM.              There is a limit in the no of jeeps that can enter the forest in a day.       Therefore we advice you to book the Jungle safari in 4x4 open Gypsies in advance.
