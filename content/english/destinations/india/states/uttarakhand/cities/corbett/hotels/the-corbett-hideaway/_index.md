A delightful resort set in ten acres of thick mango grove, The Corbett Hideaway has forty cottages that have charming red tiled roofs and stone floors.     Small private sit-outs offer a place to enjoy the greenery and the sounds of the nearby river. There is a tennis court, a billiards room, and a swimming pool. Excursions into the park by jeep and elephant are organised by the hotel.
