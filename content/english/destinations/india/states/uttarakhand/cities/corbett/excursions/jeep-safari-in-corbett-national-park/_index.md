The shared jeep safaris are accompanied by a naturalist and usually take place in the Bijrani zone of the National Park. The terrain is varied, and supports a wide variety of birdlife, particularly in the cooler winter months, plus various deer, crocodiles, elephants, and the rarely-seen leopards and tigers. Safaris take place in the early mornings and late afternoons, and you usually spend around 3 hours inside the park.
