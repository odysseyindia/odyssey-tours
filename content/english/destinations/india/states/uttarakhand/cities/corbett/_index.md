Corbett National Park was India's first national park, and remains one of its finest. It is named after the legendary hunter Jim Corbett, who lived in this area for many years and wrote 'The Man Eaters of Kumaon'. Extending over 520 sq. km., the sanctuary is endowed with breathtaking natural beauty and an abundance of wildlife including tigers and elephants. The birdlife is especially impressive, with over 500 species.
