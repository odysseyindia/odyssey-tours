The only way to visit the central, most attractive, zone of Corbett National Park is to join other visitors on a shared safari in a purpose-built, 16-seat safari vehicle called a Canter. You take a 4-5 hour safari, on a very scenic, undulating road to the Dhikala Forest Lodge in the centre of the park, with the on-board naturalist pointing out the wildlife. The hotel will provide a packed breakfast for the early morning safari.
