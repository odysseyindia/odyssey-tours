Corbett's secret is its astonishing bird-life, and the secluded resort of Vanghat was created to show off this little-known aspect. Deliberately difficult to access (either after a short trek or a raft ride), the resort is in the sal-dominated buffer zone, with simple cottages offering a base for birding, walking, angling, rafting and wildlife excursions. A highly sustainable lodge, meant for real nature enthusiasts.
