Another version of the holiday home resort, the  Kohinoor Hotel is cheerful but fairly unimaginative.     The fairly sprawling hotel complex includes a large swimming pool including some slides for children, a gymnasium and an Ayurvedic treatment centre.     The rooms are housed in faux villas, each with a sunny sit out overlooking the gardens and pool. The rooms are fairly modern but comfortable.     Situated much closer to the sites of Diu than its close competitor, the Radhika Beach Resort, the Kohinoor hotel is more accessible but farther from the Nagoa Beach.
