A wonderful, modern resort with style, Resort Hoka is definitely the best place to stay in Diu.    Just a few minutes walk from Nagoa beach, the resort is a low rise building surrounded by hall walls creating a courtyard containing Hoka trees and a delightful small pool.     The rooms are simple but generous sized and clean. The colours used are bright and cheerful which seem to be the hallmark of the resort.
