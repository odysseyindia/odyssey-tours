Mrs Bhandaris Guesthouse is very pleasant and comfortable, and above all a homely place in which to enjoy genuine Punjabi hospitality. The pleasant garden has a swimming pool and its own team of curious water buffalo.    There are separate chalets varying in size and location, arranged in and around Mrs. Bhandari's charming red-brick colonial home, complete with original 1950's fittings, furniture and atmosphere.
