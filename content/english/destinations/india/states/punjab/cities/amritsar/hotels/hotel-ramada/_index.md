A old courtyard hotel with a modern touch, Poonam Haveli is located at Lal Ghat, a pleasant bazaar area full of interesting shops.     The rooms are all beautifully painted with matched fabrics of good quality. There are common seating areas and chairs just outside the rooms where guests can relax.     The rooftop restaurant offers fabulous views of Pichola lake and the Lake Palace. The restaurant offers genuine wood-fired pizzas which are a big draw.
