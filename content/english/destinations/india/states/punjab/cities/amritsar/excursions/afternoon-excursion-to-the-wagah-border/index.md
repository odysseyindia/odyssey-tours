  - Afternoon excursion to the Wagah Border
---
The daily border closing ceremony at the Wagah Border between India and Pakistan is extraordinary street theatre. Crowds assemble in large stands on both sides of the border, with much chanting, singing of patriotic songs, and even dancing, with a faux-aggressive ceremony. The event is choreographed, and the atmosphere is actually that of a big party!
