Patiala was a princely state under the Raj, ruled by an extravagant family of Maharajas who were rather fond of constructing opulent buildings. Today, the grand monuments are all crumbling, but the old city, ringed by historic gates, retains a special feel with its bazaars, temples, fort and palaces. The city is also famous for the local measure of whisky – the Patiala peg – which is bigger than a standard peg that you get elsewhere.
