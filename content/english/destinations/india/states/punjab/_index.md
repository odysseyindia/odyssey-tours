Punjab is known as "the bread basket of the nation" as it is the largest single provider of wheat to India.      Punjab is the home state of the Sikhs. Recognisable by their characteristic turbans and full beards, the Sikhs are India's most distinctive minority and are fiercely independent and take pride in who they are.     Punjab's major attraction is the Golden Temple at Amritsar, the holiest shrine of the Sikhs.
