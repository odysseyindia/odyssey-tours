Rajkot, the former capital of the princely state of the same name, is a fast-developing city in the Saurashtra peninsula. In pre-independence days, it was the headquarters of the British Government Resident for the Western Indian States. It is associated with the early life of Mahatma Gandhi, who spent some years of his life in this town with his father who was the Dewan (Chief Minister) of Rajkot state.
