The Little Rann of Kutch is a birding paradise. Expect to see large flocks of larks, and other dryland birds like sandgrouse, coursers, plovers, chats, warblers, babblers and shrikes. Among the many winter visitors are the houbara bustard and spotted sandgrouse. The best birding is at the lakes and marshes around the Rann in winter, when you can see flamingos, pelicans, storks, ibises, spoonbill, ducks and other waterfowl.
