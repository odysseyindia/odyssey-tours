Pax should do one jeep safari and one village safari as in that case there is no extra cost. If pax want to do a second safari, then the entrance fee of the jeep is extra. Entrance fees for a jeep are actually less on weekdays. We have taken the higher amount for our costing.  The park is open all year; October to March is the best time to visit. For birders: November to February, when it is cooler and migratory birds arrive in the thousands.
