  - Early morning wildlife safari in the Little Rann of Kutch
---
A shared jeep safari across the Little Rann of Kutch, a vast expanse of salt flats and grasslands. This unique ecosystem supports a variety of wildlife including the Asiatic wild ass, found only here. The wild ass is a handsome chestnut-brown member of the horse family. Capable of reaching high speeds, the wild ass is usually seen in small herds. The elegant blackbuck, nilgai and the graceful chinkara are also seen in the Rann.
