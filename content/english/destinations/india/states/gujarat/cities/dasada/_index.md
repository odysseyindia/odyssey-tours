Dasada is a village occupied mainly by farmers, nomadic cattle herders and artisans. It is situated on the outskirts of the Rann of Kutch, a vast salt marsh that spans 30,000 sq km. Dasada is the perfect base from which to explore the Rann of Kutch, the last refuge in India of the Asiatic Wild Ass, an elegant member of the horse family. In winter it is also home to migratory birds such as flamingoes, MacQueen's Bustard etc.
