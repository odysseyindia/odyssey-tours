Welcome to the true Kutch experience - at this simple ethnic resort run by Dhanraj Malik - descendant of an erstwhile local ruler.     The experience of sleeping under thatch roofs and on local "charpoi" beds along with the visits to different tribes of the region will give you real insights into the daily life of the locals.    Dhanraj's knowledge of the 5000 square kilometers of the Rann of Kutch wildlife sanctuary and its unique fauna is unparalleled.
