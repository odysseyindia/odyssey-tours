The Blackbuck Lodge is a fabulous wildlife resort surrounded by wild country all around. The lodge has  independent cottages where every possible comfort had been taken care of - from the plump cushions on the bed and window seat, a large satellite TV, marble floors adorned with rugs, pencil drawings on the stone walls and  beautiful teak furniture - all giving the impression of a luxurious African safari lodge.
