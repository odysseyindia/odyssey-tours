Entrance fees for a jeep are actually lower on weekdays than on weekends. We have taken the higher amount for our costing.  The park is open throughout the year but mid-June to March is best time to visit.   For bird watchers winter months of December to March are the best time to visit when many migratory birds arrive to spend the winters here.
