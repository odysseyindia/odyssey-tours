A charming 19th-century mansion in a lovely garden setting. The drawing room has original French furniture amongst other period bric-a-brac, giving it a wonderfully period feel. The Nawabs of Balasinor were known for their hospitality, with kitchens famous for their distinctive Nawabi cuisine, and this is a great place to actually spend time with royalty in their own home.
