Part of a beautiful 1915 palace set in large landscaped grounds. The Rajvant Palace is popular for Bollywood film shootings. There are 24 rooms and suites but they lack maintenance. The restaurant serves a choice of vegetarian and non-vegetarian food. There is an interesting private museum which is well documented.
