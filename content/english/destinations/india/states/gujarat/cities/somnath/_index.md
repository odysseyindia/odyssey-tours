Somnath has great religious and historical significance, as the temple contains one of the 12 Jyotirlingas (Shiva Shrines). The temple was ransacked and destroyed seven times by Muslim invaders but rebuilt at the same spot each time. The present temple is a recent reconstruction in the old style. According to legend, it was in Somnath that Lord Krishna, mistaken for a deer, was mortally wounded by a Bhil tribal.
