Set in lawns and gardens beside the river Gondali, the Riverside Palace was built in 1875 in colonial style.     Much of the interiors are unchanged; there are crystal chandeliers, framed paintings and many pieces of period furniture.    The 11 double bedrooms are spacious, with heigh ceilings and lavishly appointed with elegant period furniture and western style bathrooms.    The location is idyllic with water and garden views from many places. The orchards and the river atrract a great number of resident and migratory birds.    Your stay is on Full Board.
