Gondal is a former princely state known for its progressive rulers. In the late 19th century, Gondal did away with the women's purdah or veil, abolished land taxes and insisted on education for girls. Gondal is an interesting city with some finely-carved palaces. The town is also home to an interesting 100-year-old ayurvedic pharmacy. You stay in Orchard Palace, originally built to house the guests of the Maharaja of Gondal.
