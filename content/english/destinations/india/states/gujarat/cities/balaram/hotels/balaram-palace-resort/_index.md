A majestic building built in 1930 by the ancestors of the present Nawab.  In a splendid riverside location, surrounded by hills, this sumptuous hotel has lovely landscaped gardens and a relaxing and peaceful atmosphere. The terrace has breathtaking views of the Aravali Hills. There is a period swimming pool fed by a natural cascading spring.
