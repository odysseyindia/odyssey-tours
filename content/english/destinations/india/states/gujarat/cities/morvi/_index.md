For a bustling manufacturing hub noted for its ceramic and clock-making industries, Morvi packs in a startling extent of architectural heritage. The most beautiful of all is the spectacular Darbargadh Palace. A sprawling edifice overlooking the Machhu river, this 19th-century palace was severely damaged in the 2001 earthquake, but has since been painstakingly restored by Princess Uma Morvi.
