Dwarka, in mythology, was the capital of Lord Krishna's empire. It is one of the seven sacred cities or 'Sapta Puris', and one of the four 'dhams' - supreme pilgrimage sites - for Hindus. Dwarka stands on five earlier layers of human occupation, and was visited by Adi Shankaracharya, who founded the 'Dwarka peeth' to spread Hinduism; Ramanuja; the great mystic Narsingh Mehta, Mirabai and the great saints Kabir and Guru Nanak.
