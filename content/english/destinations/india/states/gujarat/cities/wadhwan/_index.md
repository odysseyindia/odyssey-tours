Wadhwan is the center of the largest tye-dye Bandhani work in Gujarat. Most of the people in Wadhwan live in the fortified area and are, in some way, involved in Bandhani work. One can see women sitting in their balcony tying the threads before dyeing the cloth. Many houses have more workshop space than living space indicating their deep individual and community connections with tie-dye work.
