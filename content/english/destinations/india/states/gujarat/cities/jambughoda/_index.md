A tiny forested principality, the village of Jambughoda sits amongst low hills. There are small tribal hamlets scattered on the hill slopes. It is possible to visit some tribal homes to observe their unique lifestyle and ancient customs. The pithora wall paintings in the homes are of great interest. A nearby lake is good for bird watching.
