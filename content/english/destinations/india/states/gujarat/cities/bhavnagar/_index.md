Bhavnagar is a busy and friendly city, which still contains many traditional buildings with overhanging wooden balconies, and a huge marketplace. The market's lanes are extremely narrow, and bustling with life and character. The city makes a good base from which to explore the breathtaking Jain temples of Palitana, an hour's drive away.
