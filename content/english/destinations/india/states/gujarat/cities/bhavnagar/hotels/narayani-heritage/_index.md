This creamy yellow and forest green villa is built on the same grounds as the imposing Nilambagh Palace hotel.     In fact the Narayani Heritage bungalow was initially used to house the administrative offices of the Maharaja of Bhavnagar and later as a boy's school.    Finally it was converted into a small hotel offering the large, light and simply furnished rooms.     The guests also have access to the recreational facilities of the palace next door and thus guests here can indulge in a cooling swim or sweat it out on the tennis court or in their up to date gymnasium.
