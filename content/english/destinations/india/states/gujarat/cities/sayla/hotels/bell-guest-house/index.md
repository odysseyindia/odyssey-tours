The Bell Guest House is an Indo-European building that once hosted European visitors to the Sayla princely state. Set in lush green gardens with shady trees and lawns, this house has now been renovated and opened as a heritage homestay offering the personalized hospitality of the erstwhile Yuvraj and Yuvrani of Sayla. An ideal place to kick back and relax, with high-ceilinged rooms, pleasant grounds and a colonnaded verandah.
