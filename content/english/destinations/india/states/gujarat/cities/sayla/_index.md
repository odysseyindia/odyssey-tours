The village of Sayla, southwest of Ahmedabad, has historic buildings, old houses, temples, ashrams, lake, weavers and handicrafts. It is also home to The Bell Guest House, an Indo-European building that once hosted European visitors to the Sayla princely state. Set in lush green gardens with shady trees and lawns, this heritage house has now been renovated and opened as a heritage homestay.
