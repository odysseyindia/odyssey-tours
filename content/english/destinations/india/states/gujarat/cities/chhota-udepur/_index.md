Chhota Udepur is a picturesque town, centred around a lake. The town has palaces, fortifications and mansions from the days when it was an important princely state. Amongst these, the Kusam Vilas Palace, has been converted into a heritage hotel. Nowadays Chhota Udepur is the capital of a colourful tribal district where Bhils and Rathwas live in secluded villages of decorated mud huts, and hold weekly tribal markets.
