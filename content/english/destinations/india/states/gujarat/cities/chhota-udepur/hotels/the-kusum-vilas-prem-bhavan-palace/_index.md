The imposing Kusum Vilas Prem Bhavan Palace in Chhota Udepur is set in 18 acres of 'Mughal' gardens decorated with fountains, ponds and statues. The architectual style is predominantly Indo-Saracenic while the interiors reflect a strong European influence.The palace hotel has recently been opened with 13 rooms and suites, including one suite in a former Royal Railway Saloon Carriage . The rooms are comfortably furnished with modern en-suite facilities. The Palace has an indoor swimming pool, tennis court, and a billiards table.The Palace can organise jeep safaris to the nearby tribal villages to see the weekly 'haats' or markets where tribals get together to engage in lively bartering for day to day commodities.
