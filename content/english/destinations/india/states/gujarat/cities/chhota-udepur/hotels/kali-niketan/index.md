Originally called Nahar Mahal, this palatial mansion was built about 100 years ago as the summer residence of the royal family of Chhota Udepur in 60 acres by the river Orsang. Attractively set in fruit orchards, the mansion has fountains in the forecourt and in the courtyard, and terraces with good views of the gardens. The rooms feature many period touches, and lots of reminders of the glory days of the Maharajas.
