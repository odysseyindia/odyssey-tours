The coffee-coloured cottages of the Gir Birding Lodge are set in a rambling mango orchard that merges with the deciduous forests of the Gir Wildlife Sanctuary beyond. These tastefully-furnished cottages have been built to ensure privacy whilst still offering unrestricted views over the trees and fields that attract their own share of birdlife. The Gir Birding Lodge offers a good base for tracking the Asiatic Lion in the wild.
