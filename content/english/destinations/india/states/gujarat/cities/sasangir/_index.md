Sasangir is the only habitat of the lion left outside Africa, and with the lion population 300-strong, your chances of spotting one are very good. Game rides are by jeep, and best in the early morning or late afternoon. Other wildlife includes panthers, hyenas, foxes, wild boar, sambhar, and nilgai. There is also rich bird life including the rare paradise flycatcher. Just outside the sanctuary entrance is a crocodile hatchery.
