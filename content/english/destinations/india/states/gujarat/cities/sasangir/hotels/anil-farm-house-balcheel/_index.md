The Anil Farm House is just that - a converted farm house that specializes in growing that variety of mango that is famous to this region and a variety of different flowers and vegetables.     The Anil Farm House now offers 20 rooms of differing standards to the tourists that come eagerly to see the Asiatic Lion in this ultimate stronghold - the Gir Wildlife Sanctuary.     Basic but large, the rooms are built to resemble 2 storey cottages overlooking the gardens and lotus ponds.
