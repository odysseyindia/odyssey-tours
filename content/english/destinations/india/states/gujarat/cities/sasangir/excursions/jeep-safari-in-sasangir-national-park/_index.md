Gir National Park & Wildlife Sanctuary is a hilly tract of dry deciduous forests, acacia scrub, evergreen and semi-evergreen flora and grasslands, fed by rivers and streams. Among the many water-bodies in the reserve is the Kamleshwar Dam, known for its large crocodile population. Originally protected by the Nawab of Junagadh, the Sasangir Forest is the last remaining sanctuary of the Asiatic lion. You can see the lions on a jeep safari.
