One of the oldest cities in Gujarat, Surat was a flourishing centre of international trade since the 14th century. Surat was the chief port of the Mughal empire; from here pilgrims would sail to Mecca. The British set up their first factory in India here in 1612, and during the 17th and 18th century it became one of India's richest cities. Today Surat boasts of a diamond cutting and polishing industry, and textile mills.
