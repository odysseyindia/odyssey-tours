Set back from the beach at Mandvi is the Maharaja of Bhuj's present home - the Vijay Vilas Palace.     A luxury tented camp has been created on a beautiful stretch of private beach belonging to the Maharaja. Here you can relax in luxurious air conditioned tents that resemble the colonial era hunting camps of the Maharajas.     You can also feast on the wide variety of seafood that Gujarat's 1,666 km coastline supplies.
