The Hotel Prince is a 30 year old Bhuj institution. Its modern rooms and unbeatable local food continues to draw both Indians and foreign visitors.     A 3 star hotel, the Prince offers a range of rooms which are renovated every 6 months to give them a fresh, newly finished feel.     The spacious rooms have discreet, diffused lighting which reveals light coloured flooring and walls with patterns of purple and orange.
