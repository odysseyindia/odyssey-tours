In the villages around Bhuj, the tribal people turn out exquisite handloomed woollen and cotton clothes decorated with dye or embroidery, often with mirror-work.     The small village of Bhujodi, 10km from Bhuj, is home to the Rabari or local cattle-herding community. There are 250 families in the village and all of them are weavers. Women manufacture the yarn while the men work on the handlooms. You can visit the artisans in their homes to see the process for weaving from buying cotton to making thread and weaving it on loom.    The nearby village of Ajrakhpur is home of the traditional Ajrakh block printing style that uses natural dyes made from turmeric, pomegranate, ink and mud to create endless yards of fabric. The printing blocks are often shaped and carved by hand using absolute precision and skill. Almost every family in the village contributes to this complex art form in some way. Ajrakhpur has also a wonderful `Living and Learning Design Centerâ€™ (closed on Mondays & public holidays).  A little further is Dhaneti village where you can see the embroidery skills of the Ahir community. Ahir embroidery is known for its prolific use of mirrors, floral designs, parrots and peacocks. Each stitch and motif has a specific name. They tend to use a variety of base fabrics. These include tie-dye bandhani fabrics in reds and oranges, and satin weave mashru that has a silky feel.
