Bhuj is the capital of the Kutch province, known for its congregation of textile weavers and designers. The now deserted palace buildings of the Aina Mahal and Prag Mahal have an eerie beauty. Bhuj is the perfect base for visiting villages in Kutch, where the tribal people turn out exquisite hand-loomed woollen and cotton clothes decorated with dye or embroidery.
