Not far north of Bhuj is a village called Zura where Huser Sidhik and his family keep alive the art of copper-bell making. Made from scrap metal, the copper is moulded and crafted into bells of all shapes and sizes. No two bells are alike in their chimes, which is truly remarkable.    A few kilometres from Zura is the village of Nirona where the delicate art form known as Rogan Art originated. The technique, which was traditionally used to adorn bridal wear, involves dipping a metal needle in vibrant oil-based paints to create designs on fabric.    Further north is the small village of Bhirandiyara, known for its fine embroidery work.  While the women create fascinating designs of clothes, bed sheets, wall hangings, table cloths, jewellery, toys, hand bags and more, the men create all sorts of leather products.    The diminishing craft of Khavda pottery is still practiced by a handful of artisanal communities in this northern Kutch village. While the men do the throwing of the terracotta, the women are in charge of the surface decoration.    The village of Hodka has picturesque thatched-roofed mud huts known as Bhungas, with hand-painted exterior walls and interior walls adorned with mud-mirror work. The leather bags and quilts of the village are especially popular, known for their colourful hues and fine embroidery.
