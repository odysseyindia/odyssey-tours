The Bhuj House is a traditional Parsi courtyard house in the historic town of Bhuj. Built in the late 1800s, it has stood through seven generations of the Bhujwala family, and survived the devastating Bhuj earthquake of 2001. The family have lovingly restored the house, opening it as a delightful four-room heritage homestay.
