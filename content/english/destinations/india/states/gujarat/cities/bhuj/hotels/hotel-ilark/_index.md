The Hotel Ilark is the new but rapidly rising star of Bhuj.     Only a year old, the Ilark is small for a business hotel but sharply stylish.     The decor is mainly white and the rooms have muted lighting and are imaginatively decorated.     The restaurant takes turns to serve up authentic Gujarati vegetarian and international cuisine.     Situated within easy distance of the main sites of Bhuj, the Ilark promises modern elegance and sophistication in a small town.
