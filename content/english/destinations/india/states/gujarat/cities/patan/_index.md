Patan is a beautiful old town with Jain temples and carved wooden houses. It has an impressive step-well and lake. The 1,000-year-old step-well at Patan is in a well-maintained park and is one of the best remaining examples of its type, which used to be found throughout the dry state of Gujarat. It is richly decorated, and extends down for several levels to reach the water table.
