The ancient, fortified city of Junagadh (its name means ‘old fort’) has a history stretching back 2300 years. By the 19th century, the Nawabs of Junagadh rose to become affluent rulers and during their reign palaces, colleges, mosques, mausoleum complexes and a quaint railway station came up at Junagadh, all of which are worth seeing, especially the palace museum.
