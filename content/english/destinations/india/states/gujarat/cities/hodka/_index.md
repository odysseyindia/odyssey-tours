Hodka is a little village north of Bhuj surrounded by an area of impressive natural beauty, an ideal base to discover Kutch. Kutch is renowned for its arts and crafts and is also visited by bird watchers for spotting migratory birds in winter. The local people of Hodka have built a resort using only local building materials and natural products and in the same style as their own village houses.
