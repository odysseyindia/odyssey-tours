Situated on the Tropic of Cancer, the Sun Temple of Modhera is one of the finest examples of Indian temple architecture. Built in 1026 A.D., the temple is dedicated to the Sun God, Surya, and stands high on a plinth overlooking a deep stone-stepped tank. Every inch of the edifice, both inside and outside, is magnificently carved with gods and goddesses, birds, animals and flowers.
