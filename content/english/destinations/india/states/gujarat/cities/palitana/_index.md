In the holy city of Palitana, Shatrunjay Hill is the holiest place on Earth in Jainism, a belief system that revolves around non-violence toward all living things - people, animals, even insects. Shatrunjay is a hill of steps stretching 591m high, with 863 magnificent marble Jain temples, mostly from the 16th century. From the top of the hill is a breathtaking panoramic view of the Gulf of Cambay and the countryside.
