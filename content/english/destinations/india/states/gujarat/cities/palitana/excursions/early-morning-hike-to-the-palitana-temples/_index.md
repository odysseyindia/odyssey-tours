This temple city is the largest of its kind in India. The 863 temples date from the 11th to the 16th century and are dedicated to the 24 different gods worshipped in the Jain religion. The Palitana temples are on top of Shatrunjay hill. The winding 3.5-km path to the top has 3,950 steps and you can do this on your own without a guide. The reward for the climb is a superb view and the extraordinary temples themselves.
