The tiny town of Danta is situated in northern Gujarat, just 40 km south of Abu Road. It is surrounded by the oldest mountain range, the Aravalis, which are still home to two very old tribes, The Bhils and The Garasiyas. These tribals live in the little hamlets in the hills and their main occupation is farming and dairy.
