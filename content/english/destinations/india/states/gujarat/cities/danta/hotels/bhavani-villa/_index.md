Bhavani Villa Homestay is the ancestral home of the royal family of the former princely state of Danta. The welcome is warm and hospitable, and the views over the surrounding countryside expansive and peaceful. The Maharana will take you on an afternoon tour by jeep and you may be able to visit his horse stud farm. Dinner is a family affair here, and the accommodation comfortable and spacious.
