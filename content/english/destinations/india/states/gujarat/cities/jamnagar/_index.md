The old princely city of Jamnagar is dominated by its many palaces. Known for its tie-and-dye (bandhini) fabrics and temples, Jamnagar also has a bird-rich lake. Jamnagar is the headquarters of the Gulf of Kutch Marine National Park and Wildlife Reserve, which protects 42 islands fringed by coral reefs and mangroves. These islands and coastal areas are excellent for birding, attracting large wintering flocks of various birds.
