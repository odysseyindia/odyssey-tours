Poshina, in the north of Gujarat, is a village where time has stood still. Far from the bustle of Ahmedabad, this is a rural area predominantly inhabited by Bhil and Garasia tribals, known for their colourful attire and artistic ornaments. Potters, arrow-crafters and metal artisans can be seen at work. The terracotta horses of Poshina are a well known handicraft, as are swords, daggers, silver ornaments and grass jewellery.
