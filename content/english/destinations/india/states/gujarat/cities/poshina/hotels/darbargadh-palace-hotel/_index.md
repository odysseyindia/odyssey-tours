A 17th century haveli with delicate arches and airy verandahs running the length of the building.  Some of the 15 rooms have very good period furniture. The aristocratic family who owns the place is very knowledgeable about the colourful tribals from the surrounding areas and can help organise excursions to experience their way of life. Your stay here is on full board.
