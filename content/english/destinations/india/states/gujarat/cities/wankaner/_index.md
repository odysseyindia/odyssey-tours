Wankaner is a dusty little town that specializes in the making of roof and floor tiles. Wankaner is lent distinction by Ranjit Vilas Palace, which features pointed Gothic arches, Mughal domes and Rajasthani pavilions. As the royal family still lives in the palace, guests are accommodated in the Royal Oasis, a few kilometres away. It is the perfect place if you want to be treated as a Maharaja and just want to relax.
