Located in lush green gardens, the summer palace of the Maharaja of Wankaner is a true Art Deco bungalow.    Royal Oasis has just a handful of spacious rooms. All rooms are elegantly appointed and have most of their original furniture intact, with some extravagant pieces.     There is also an indoor swimming pool and a beautiful step-well.
