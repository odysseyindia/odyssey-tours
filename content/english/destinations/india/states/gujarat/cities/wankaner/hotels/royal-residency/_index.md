The Royal Residency started out as the home of the British Resident to the Wankaner princely state in 1882.     Built on the same grounds as the home of the royals, the Ranjit Vilas Palace, the Residency offers unrestricted and spectacular views of the Palace and of the town.     The 12 suites of the Residency were orginally designed with particular friends of the royal family in mind, such as, the Duke of Connaught, jeweller Jacques Cartier and the father of the great Mahatma Gandhi. Most suites still bear memorabilia related to these esteemed guests.     The Royal Residency is only used when the Royal Oasis is full.
