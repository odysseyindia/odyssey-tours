CEDO is very much a birder's hideout, with over 350 species to look for, and the centre is run by incorrigible twitchers. The homestay organises safaris in closed jeeps into the arid countryside, with experienced local guides. Apart from the birds, you are likely to spot jungle cats, nilgai, jackals, mongooses, an array of lizards and butterflies, and if you're lucky, a desert cat or striped hyena as well.
