In the lap of the Aravalli Hills in Gujarat, lies the untouched town of Santrampur, which is riddled with ancient palaces and striking temple ruins. Santrampur comprises two townships, Sant and Rampur. While Rampur is the commercial town or the ‘city centre’, Sant was reserved for the palaces. Santrampur and its neighbouring areas are predominantly inhabited by tribals.
