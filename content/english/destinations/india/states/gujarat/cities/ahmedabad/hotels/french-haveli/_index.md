The Coral Tree is a newly opened  homestay in Agra, conveniently located just 10 minutes walking distance from the Taj Mahal. The spacious rooms overlook a very well kept garden which is a haven for birds.     There is a well stocked library on India in the lounge which is also the dining area. You can savour some delicious home-cooked meals here.    Vandna and Gopal Singh are wonderful hosts. Being passionate naturalists themselves, they would love to accompany you on a Taj Nature Walk with a view of The Taj Mahal in the back drop.
