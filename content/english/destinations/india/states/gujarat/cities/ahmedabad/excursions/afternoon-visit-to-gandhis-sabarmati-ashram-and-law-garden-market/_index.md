Alongside the Sabaramati River, the Ashram was the home of Mahatma Gandhi from 1915 to 1930, and the seeds of India's Independence campaign were sown here. His simple living quarters are maintained exactly as they were at that time. There is also a museum dedicated to his life.     The nearby Law Garden Market operates from late afternoon and has stalls selling colourful local fabrics, as well as a "food street" with local fast food outlets - the kulfi falooda is highly recommended at the end of a hot day.
