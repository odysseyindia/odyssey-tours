You join a group of like-minded travellers on an early-morning guided group walk through the narrow lanes of the historic Old City of Ahmeadbad. This is a fascinating maze of crowded bazaars, residential areas and subterranean step-wells. At the end of the 2-hour walk, you return to the hotel for a late breakfast.
