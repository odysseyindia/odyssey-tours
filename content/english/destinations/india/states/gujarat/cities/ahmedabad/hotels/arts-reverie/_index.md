The Art Reverie guesthouse is possibly the closest you'll get to living like the humble hoi polloi of Gujarat's capital city - Ahmedabad.     A converted 'pol' or traditional community house within the old part of the city, the guesthouse has the feel of a doll house with compact but colourful rooms. The building is surrounded by other "pols" and allows you a glimpse into the soul of old Ahmedabad.
