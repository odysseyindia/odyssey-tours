You join a morning guided group walk through the narrow atmospheric lanes of the historic Old City. This is a fascinating maze of crowded bazaars, exquisitely carved facades, temples, subterranean step-wells, and even a secret passageway. You first walk through a Hindu dominated area, then a section dominated by Jains, then finally to the Muslim market area to end at the city's largest mosque.
