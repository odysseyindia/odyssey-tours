32km northwest of Hassan, the tiny hamlet of Halebid was once the capital of the Hoysalas, who ruled over south Karnataka from the 11th to the 14th century. The Hoysaleshvara Temple has a wealth of sculptural detail, the walls covered with gods, goddesses, animals and dancing girls. No two facets of the temple are alike. Guarded by a Nandi Bull, it was never completed, despite 86 years of work.
