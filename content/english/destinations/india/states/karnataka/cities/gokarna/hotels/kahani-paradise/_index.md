Just south of Goa is a beautiful luxury villa with terrific views over the Arabian Sea. Large rooms and bathrooms with lovely antiques, airy common areas, an infinity pool, a spa and stunning views are on offer here, with communal dining and plenty of scope for championship-level relaxation. An unusual stay option in a quiet part of the Western Indian coast, great for those who want a little indulgence.
