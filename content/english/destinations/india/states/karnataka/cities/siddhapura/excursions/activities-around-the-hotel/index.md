A coffee plantation offers plenty of active and completely inactive options to pass the time, from a guided tour of the plantation and the coffee process, to walking trails, or using the spa, enjoying a cup on the verandah of the main lodge, to birdwatching or simply relaxing in the reading room.  Coorg also has a number of viewpoints, waterfalls and hiking trails - please ask at the hotel if you wish to explore these.
