On the banks of the Cauvery river in Kodagu (Coorg), the sleepy coffee town called Siddhapura is set amidst hundreds of acres of coffee and spice plantations dotted with banana and coconut palms. Hiking cross-country, or simply driving down the mountain roads, you encounter panoramic views of the morning mist rolling down thickly wooded hills, undulating paddy fields and neat rows of coffee bushes.
