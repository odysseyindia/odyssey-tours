Nestled on the fringes of the vast Bandipur forest reserve, this luxury resort attracts visitors of not only human species: look for pugmarks and hoofprints on the pathways! The spacious rooms and log huts (on stilts) look out over grassland towards the nearby hills, and are stylish places to relax in. The resort also offers outdoor dining by the forest, a spa, a large swimming pool and great service.
