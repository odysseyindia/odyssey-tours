The mixed tropical and deciduous forests of Bandipur have tigers (although spotting have become rare over the last decade), leopards, elephants and wild boars. The 180 birds species include kingfishers, jungle babblers, fishing eagles, horned owls and peacocks. This sanctuary is also good for spotting the flying squirrel, and itâ€™s one of the best parks to visit during the monsoon season.
