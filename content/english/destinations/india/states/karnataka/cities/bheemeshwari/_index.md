In the forests of Karnataka, mid-way Bangalore and Mysore, is Bheemeshwari, a fishermanâ€™s paradise. This is the home of the 'Mahseer', the finest game fish in the tropics, besides varieties of carp and catfish. You can fish from the river banks or from a coracle, a round boat made of buffalo hide. For non-anglers, there are nature walks and bird watching. The best season for visiting Bheemeshwari is November to May.
