Belgaum is a charming city nestling in the foothills of the Western Ghats. Having been ruled by the Chalukyas, the Goa Kadambas, the Yadavas, the Vijayanagar rulers, the Brahmins, the Adil Shahis and the Marathas, there are ample reminders of the tumultuous days gone by. Added to these arcaeological monuments is the natural beauty of the place with gushing rivers, enchanting hills and evergreen forests.
