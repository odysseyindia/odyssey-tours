For much of its history one of the most important ports in India, Mangalore has for more than a thousand years traded in coffee, pepper, cashew nuts and ginger from Coorg and Kerala. Mangalore is a convenient staging post for journeys along the coast between Goa and Kerala, or inland to the hills of Coorg, or the Hoysala monuments near Hassan. South of the city are beautiful beaches, being newly developed for tourism.
