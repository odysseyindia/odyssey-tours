A lovely beach resort run by the very friendly Albuquerque family. The hotel consists of 2 or 3 bedroom cottages with private sit-outs. It offers indoor games like table-tennis and pool, a swimming pool and a tennis and indoor badminton court. The restaurant's main emphasis is on the freshly caught sea-food and there are several Goan delicacies on offer.
