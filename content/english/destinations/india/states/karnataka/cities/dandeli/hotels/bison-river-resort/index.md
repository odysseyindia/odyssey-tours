A simple resort in a fabulous setting. Located right near one of the biggest rapids of the Kali river, the Bison River resort offers simple rooms in cottage style accommodation. The resort organises jeep safaris in the reserve with naturalist guides. Coracle rides on the river are good for bird-watching.  Your stay is on full board and includes all jungle activities. The white water rafting trip can be booked directly with the hotel.
