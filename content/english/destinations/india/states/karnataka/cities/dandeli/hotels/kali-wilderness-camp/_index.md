A simple and rustic resort. Situated on the banks of the Kali river, the camp consists of cottages and fully furnished tents with attached private facilities.  The camp is run by the same professional organisation which owns and runs the famous Kabini river lodge in Nagarhole. White water rafting facilities are available here.
