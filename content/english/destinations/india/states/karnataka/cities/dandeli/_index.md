Dandeli can be approached from Goa or Karwar, a 3 hour drive from either direction. The scenery is magnificent with winding roads and beautiful mostly moist deciduous forests and teak plantations. The Dandeli wildlife park is perched along the Kali river; most of the wildlife consists of gaur, wild dog, barking deer, flying squirrels, wild elephants and if one is lucky the panther. Dandeli also has a rich bird life. Exciting white water rafting is organised on the Kali river. The best time to visit the park is November to May.
