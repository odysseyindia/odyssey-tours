Belur, 37km northwest of Hassan, was the Hoysala capital - prior to Halebid - during the 11th and 12th centuries. Still in use, the Chennakeshava temple is a fine example of the singular Hoysala style. It took 103 years to complete and the facade of the temple is covered with intricate sculptures. In the temple are awe-inspiring hand-lathe-turned filigreed pillars. The Veeranarayana Temple and the smaller shrines are also worth a visit.
