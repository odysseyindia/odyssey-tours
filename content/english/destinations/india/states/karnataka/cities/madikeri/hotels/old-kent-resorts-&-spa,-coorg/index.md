Old Kent is located on a 200-acre plantation of coffee, pepper and cardamom in India. Built in 1864, Old Kent Lodge is perched at a vantage point within the estate. The verandah of the lodge offers a breathtaking view of the surrounding mountains. The spacious cottages, under a lush canopy of teak, rosewood and mahogany trees, combine luxury with colonial charm (including fitted Epsom-salt foot baths!).
