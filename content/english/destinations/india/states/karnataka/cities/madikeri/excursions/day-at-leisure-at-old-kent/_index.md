A coffee plantation offers plenty of active and completely inactive options to pass the time, from a guided tour of the plantation and the coffee process, to walking trails, or using the spa, enjoying a cup on the verandah of the main lodge, to bird-watching or simply reading under the trees. Village walks, a coracle ride, and other activities can be booked directly at the resort. Coorg also has a number of viewpoints, waterfalls and hiking trails - please ask at the hotel if you wish to explore these.
