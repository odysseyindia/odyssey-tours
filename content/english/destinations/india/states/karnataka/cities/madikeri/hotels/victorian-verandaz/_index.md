Victorian Verandaz is a small homestay with just a few rooms with attached bathroom, a common dining room and a lovely verandah overlooking the plantation.     The homestay is set in a sprawling, 150-year-old estate that is spread over 110 acres, Grown here are coffee, pepper, cardamom and paddy. Parts of the property are water bodies and still uncultivated jungle areas. This estate has 3 man-made lakes and 1 natural one. A number of perennial streams run through the terrain, which you can explore with the owner, Tim, and his delightful Labrador.
