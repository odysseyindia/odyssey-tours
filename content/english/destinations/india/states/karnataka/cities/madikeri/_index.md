The market town of Madikeri is the capital of the Kodagu (Coorg) region, a cool, green, mountainous area. Madikeri is famed for its temples and 19th-century fort, which houses a museum and a chapel. The beauty of Coorg though is in the picturesque countryside, where the roads are lined with hedgerows, flowering trees, spice plantations and coffee estates. It is a perfect area for walks, ranging from simple strolls through the coffee plantations on the outskirts of the town, to longer treks in the surrounding mountains.
