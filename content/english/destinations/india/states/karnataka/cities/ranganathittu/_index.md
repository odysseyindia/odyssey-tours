Just a little north of Mysore, this lovely wetland is host to some 170 species of birds, including  the painted stork, Asian openbill stork, common spoonbill, woolly-necked stork, black-headed ibis, lesser whistling duck, stork-billed kingfisher, and more. In the winter, up to 40,000 migrants from Siberia, Latin America and northern India find their way here, making it an ornithologist's paradise. Ranger-guided boat tours are available, and are a good way to see the nesting birds from June to November, and the winter migrants in December-January.
