In the morning, you will have a guided tour of Badami's cave temples, some of the oldest in the Deccan region. These Hindu and Jain temples were carved into soft sandstone, and feature some beautiful carvings of the Nataraj (dancing Shiva) and especially Lord Vishnu, dating back to the 6th century. The Jain caves, built somewhat later, also contain fascinating carvings. After this tour, you carry on to the nearby villages of Pattadakal and Aihole. 


Once a secondary capital of the Badami Chalukyas, the tiny village of Pattadakal is now lost in the countryside but still famous for its finely carved Hindu and Jain temples, which are collectively a World Heritage Site. Pattadakal has a group of monuments consisting of 10 temples on the banks of the river Malaprabha representing early Chalukyan architecture. The detailed descriptions in the sculptures of the temples give an insight into the social life of those days.


Aihole is a small village near Badami, surrounded by small hillocks and scattered rock-cut shrines. However, in the 5th century, Aihole was the capital of Chalukya kingdom, teeming with scholars, and a centre of learning science and temple-building. A visit to the temples that remain gives a glimpse into how temple architecture evolved over the centuries.
