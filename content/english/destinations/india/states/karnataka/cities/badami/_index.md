The sleepy villages of Badami, Pattadakal and Aihole were once the capital cities of the Chalukyas, who ruled much of the Deccan between the 4th and 8th centuries. They built an astonishing profusion of temples, many still beautifully preserved. At Badami there are many cave temples, with rock-cut sculptures of religious figures. This is a fascinating, little-visited area, definitely worth the effort in getting here.
