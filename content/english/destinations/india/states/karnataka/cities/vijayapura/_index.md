Vijayapura (formerly Bijapur) boasts some of India's finest Muslim monuments, dating from the 15th to the 17th centuries when Bijapur was the capital of the Adil Shahi kings. Most famous is the Golgumbaz, a.vast mausoleum topped with an enormous dome, the second-largest in the world after St Peter's in the Vatican. The Jama Masjid and other examples of Muslim architecture are scattered throughout this traditional, fascinating town.
