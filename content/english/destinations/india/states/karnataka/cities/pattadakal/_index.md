Once a secondary capital of the Badami Chalukyas, this tiny village is now lost in the countryside but still famous for its finely carved Hindu and Jain temples, which are collectively a World Heritage Site. Pattadakal has a group of monuments consisting of 10 temples on the banks of the river Malaprabha representing early Chalukyan architecture. The detailed descriptions in the sculptures of the temples give an insight into the social life of those days.
