Book a massage or relax in the Jacuzzi in the tranquil Robusta Spa. There are also two steam baths and invigorating ice showers. The swimming pool has spectacular views across the paddy fields to the Western Ghats. If you are more energetic, you can do a guided trek through the coffee estate with its abundant birdlife or do a workout in the secluded, well-equipped gym with sweeping views over the coffee and cardamom estate.
