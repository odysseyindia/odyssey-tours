Located in the heart of Bangalore, this heritage cottage dating back to 1915 has been lovingly restored to include modern facilities, whilst retaining the historic atmosphere.    Set in the middle of a lush green garden in a quiet lane in the heart of Bangalore, Casa Piccola Cottage offers 15 rooms on bed and breakfast basis. Breakfast in the pergola beside the immaculate lawn is a treat.
