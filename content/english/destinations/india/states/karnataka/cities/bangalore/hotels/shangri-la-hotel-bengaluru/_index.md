A modern luxury hotel that dominates the Bangalore skyline. Located midway between the business and historic attractions, it offers a very comfortable stay and convenience, especially for those using Bangalore as an entry/exit point for India. The restaurants are excellent, the rooms are modern and tasteful, and the service is of a very high standard.
