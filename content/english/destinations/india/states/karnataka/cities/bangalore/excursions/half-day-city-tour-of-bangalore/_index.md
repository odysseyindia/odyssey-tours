Bangalore is the capital of Karnataka. The Assembly Building, Tipu Sultan's Summer Palace, the Sri Gavi Gangadhareshwara Cave Temple, the 16th century Bull Temple and the Kempe Gowda Fort are some of the attractions.    


The Lallbagh Gardens form one of India's most beautiful botanical gardens. The park was laid out in the 18th century by Hyder Ali and his son Tipu Sultan who brought rare trees from far off places. It now contains many labeled centuries-old trees, one of India's largest collections of rare tropical and subtropical plants, and a glasshouse modeled on London's Crystal Palace.
