Hampi was the capital of the Vijayanagar empire from 1336 to 1565. The city was well planned, with an efficient sewage system, a bustling marketplace full of luxurious goods, and countless palaces and temples. Today, the extensive ruins at Hampi tell a mysterious story about a bygone civilization. The landscape is remarkable, with miles and miles of granite boulders and huge rock formations standing against the blue skies.
