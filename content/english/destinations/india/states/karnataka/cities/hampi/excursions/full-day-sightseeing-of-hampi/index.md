In the 16th century, Hampi rivalled Rome in splendour and the Vijayanagar empire controlled almost all of south India from here. After Muslim invasions, only the stone buildings and a ghost city remained. The ruins however are extensive, and are located amongst a spectacular landscape of boulders. Many of Hampi's ruins, such as the Lotus Temple, the Royal Enclosure, the Elephant Stables, the Queen's Bath, and the Vittala Temple, can be reached by road, but it is also well worth exploring on foot, or by bicycle, as this is a unique landscape, with a seemingly infinite number of atmospheric ruins scattered throughout a huge area.
