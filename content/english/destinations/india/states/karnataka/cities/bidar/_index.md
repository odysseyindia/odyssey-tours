A pleasant town where one can visit abandoned 15th-century palaces, mosques and huge domed tombs, some of the finest examples of Muslim architecture in the Deccan. Bidar is still a centre of 'Bidriware', in which beautiful flowing floral and arabesque patterns are inlaid and engraved on various objects. This technique was developed by Persian silversmiths, whose descendants can be seen at work in the old part of town.
