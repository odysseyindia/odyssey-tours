Aihole is a small village near Badami, surrounded by small hillocks and scattered rock cut shrines. However, in the 5th century, Aihole was the capital of Chalukya Kingdome, beaming with intelligentsia. People travelled from far flung places to learn the science as well as the art of temple building in Aihole. The education of temple building began as early as the 5th century and continued till 12th century. A visit to the temples thar remain gives a glimpse on how temple architecture evolved over the centuries.
