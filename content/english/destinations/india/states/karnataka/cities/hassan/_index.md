Hassan is convenient for visiting Belur and Halebid, once the capital cities of the Hoysala kings. Great warriors, the Hoysala kings also patronised culture and art. The artisans were encouraged to rival each other and even sign their names on their intricate works of art. The temples, built as prayers for victory in battle, are small but superbly conceived.
