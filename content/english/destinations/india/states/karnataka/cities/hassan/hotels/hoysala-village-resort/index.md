Hoysala Village Resort is a charming modern resort built in the traditional `bungalow' style. The bungalows have red-tiled sloping roofs and verandahs and courtyards, which create a light and airy atmosphere. There are 33 rooms in clusters set in a pleasant garden, with some rooms overlooking the swimming pool. The rooms are comfortably furnished and are decently sized.
