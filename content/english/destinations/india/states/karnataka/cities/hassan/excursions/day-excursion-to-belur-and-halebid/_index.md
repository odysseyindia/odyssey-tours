Belur, 37 km northwest of Hassan, was the Hoysala capital - prior to Halebid - during the 11th and 12th centuries. Still in use, the Chennakeshava temple is a fine example of the singular Hoysala style. It took 103 years to complete and the facade of the temple is covered with intricate sculptures and frescoes - awe-inspiring in their workmanship. In the temple are hand-lathe turned filigreed pillars. The Veeranarayana Temple and the smaller shrines are also worth a visit.    32 km northwest of Hassan, the tiny hamlet of Halebid was once the capital of the Hoysala dynasty, who ruled over south Karnataka from the 11th until the early 14th centuries, when the city was sacked by forces of the Delhi Sultanate. Despite the sacking, several large Hoysala temples survive. The Hoysaleshvara Temple has a wealth of sculptural detail, the walls covered with gods, goddesses, animals and dancing girls. No two facets of the temple are alike. Guarded by a Nandi Bull, it was never completed, despite 86 years of work.
