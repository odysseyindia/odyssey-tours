      We rent out four rooms with separate toilet and bathroom that is shared
      between two rooms. There are fans but no A/C. Itâ€™s very much sharing my
      home.

Mysore BnB has provided informal, homely accommodation for almost a decade. A two-floor house in a quiet residential area, ten minutes from the Palace, it offers four rooms with shared toilet and bathroom. The British host is wonderful, full of cheer and extremely knowledgeable about Mysore. He operates his own cycling tours, which you can book right there, or simply get useful information and a homemade map. You can request home-cooked Indian vegetarian meals available at home or as a picnic, and also babysitting and cookery lessons.
