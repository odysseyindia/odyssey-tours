At Somnathpur is a magnificent 13th-century Hoysala temple, similar to those at Belur and Halebid. The Hoysala kings decorated every inch of  their temples, both inside and out, with a staggering profusion of superb sculptures depicting just about every aspect of life at that time. The star-shaped Somnathpur temple is the most complete example of this astonishing art.
