The focal point of the city is the 19th-century Maharaja's Palace. Part of it is still used by the royal family on festive occasions; the other part is a museum. The collection, which includes a golden howdah (elephant saddle) that kings used during processions, gives a taste of the splendid lifestyle of the Wodeyar rulers of Mysore.     The Wodeyars were devoted to the goddess Chamundesvari, enshrined on Chamundi Hill (13km away). Half way up the hill is a gigantic monolithic Nandi Bull, about 5m high. There is also a 12th-century temple dedicated to the goddess.
