A lovingly restored palace at the edge of town, originally built for Mysore's royal princesses, the old Chittaranjan Palace is now a lovely heritage hotel set in beautiful gardens.     There are some fabulous suites in the main building, all with period furniture, and more moderate rooms in the garden annexe.     There is also a well stocked library and guests can play chess or carrom in the main hall.
