Mysore (or Mysuru) is a friendly and easy-going city with a pleasant climate. With a number of beautiful palaces and pre-Independence architecture, Mysore has a faded grandeur and small-town charm. The city is a crafts centre, and has numerous shops selling a wide range of sandalwood, rosewood and teak carvings, furniture, traditional Mysore silk, puppets and lacquer-ware and other handicrafts.
