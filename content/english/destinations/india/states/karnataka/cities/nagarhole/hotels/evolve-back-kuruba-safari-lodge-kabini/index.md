category: Superior hotel
---
This luxury lodge is built in authentic tribal village style. Each thatched hut has a plunge pool or jacuzzi in a private, open-to-sky courtyard. The resort is in the heart of the tribal area of Nagarhole forest, surrounded on three sides by the Kabini river. It's a wonderful, luxurious option in Nagarhole, with an infinity pool, two very good restaurants, and activities like a night walk to look for smaller wildlife.
