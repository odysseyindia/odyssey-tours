Nagarhole National Park extends north of the Kabini River, which was dammed in 1974 to form a picturesque artificial lake. This perennial water source attracts large numbers of animals. The park has elephants, gaur, dhole, wild cats, four-horned antelopes, flying squirrels, sloth bears, monkeys, sambhar deer, panthers and many varieties of birds, as well as tigers.
