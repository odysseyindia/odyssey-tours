Kabini River Lodge, the former Maharaja's hunting lodge, has a vast wooded compound, splendid lakeside scenery and an old-world air. As the only place in Nagarhole allowed to operate jeep safaris, this is the best place to stay if you're very serious about wildlife spotting. Professional jeep and boat safaris offer good sightings of wildlife. Your stay is on full board and includes all jungle activities.
