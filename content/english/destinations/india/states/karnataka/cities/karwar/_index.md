The port city of Karwar provides good connections for those travelling along the scenic coastal highway between Goa and Mangalore, or the equally good inland highway to Hampi via Hubli. The wildlife sanctuary of Dandeli is just a 3 hour drive away along a winding ghat road. A short speedboat ride from Karwar takes you to Devbagh, a casuarina-filled island, with a long, sandy and totally undisturbed beach.
