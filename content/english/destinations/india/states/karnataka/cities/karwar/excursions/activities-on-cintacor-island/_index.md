You can enjoy multiple optional activities during your island stay, with dolphin-spotting cruises (with a naturalist or without), nature walks, climbing, rappelling, a tour of the lighthouse, fishing, water sports, an infinity pool plus an indulgent spa. The 33-acre NatureLab is a fascinating place for learning about marine life and the various flora and fauna on the island.
