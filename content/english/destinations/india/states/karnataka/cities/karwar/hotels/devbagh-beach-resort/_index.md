An extremely charming and secluded island resort - this is as close to one can get to a 'deserted island' whilst still being looked after. Situated just 100 metres from the waterline, the rooms are built on stilts - like log cabins, and are simply but charmingly furnished. Each room has a sit-out and private, clean facilities attached. Your stay is on Full Board.
