An astonishing thing: a completely private island in bustling India! A short boat ride from Karwar city gets you to this lovely retreat, with its airy cottages and total seclusion. You can enjoy the island in multiple ways, with dolphin-spotting cruises, nature walks, climbing, fishing, water sports, an infinity pool and three separate locations for your meals, plus an indulgent spa. A very different side to India, and a great end to a trip.
