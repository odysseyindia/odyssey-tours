Set amongst coffee, cardamom and pepper plantations, the Green Hills Estate is a stately old mansion dating back to 1898. The residence was built for the Diwan (Prime Minister) of Kodagu.     The mansion is surrounded by shady canopies of raintrees, coconuts, slender Areca palms and mature teak and mahogany trees.
