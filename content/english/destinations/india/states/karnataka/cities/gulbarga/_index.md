Gulbarga (or Kalaburagi) was the capital of the Bahmani dynasty. Later captured by the Adil Shahis and Mughals, it has remained a staunchly Muslim town. The most striking remains are the fort, with its citadel and mosque, the Jama Mashid (modelled on the great mosque of Cordoba), and its domed tomb, the Dargah of Bande Nawaz, the great Sufi saint and spiritual mentor of the Bahmani rulers.
