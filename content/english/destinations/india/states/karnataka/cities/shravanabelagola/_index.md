51km south-east of Hassan, this is an important Jain pilgrim centre. Atop a 150m high hill, reached by 700 steps, stands an extraordinary 17m statue of a naked male figure, said to be the world's tallest monolithic structure. The statue represents the prince Bahubali, who gained enlightenment after a bitter war of succession. Thousands of devotees congregate here to perform the 'Mahamastakabhisheka', a spectacular ceremony held once in 12 years, when the 1,000-year-old statue is anointed with milk, curds, ghee, saffron and gold coins. You can visit Shravanabelagola en route from Mysore or Bangalore to Hassan or Chikmagalur.
