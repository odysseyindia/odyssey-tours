Today, rise early to explore the Sattal (seven lakes region). Set amongst dense forests of oak and pine trees, Sattal is one of the few unspoiled and unpolluted freshwater biomes in India. The Sattal and Bhimtal (the lake of Lord Bhim, from the Mahabharata) lakes are a paradise for migratory birds. You will enjoy a picnic breakfast en route to Sattal.    After returning to Fredy's Bungalow for lunch, you head off in the late afternoon to walk around Chafi, one of the nicest birding spots in the hills. Look for whistling thrushes and spotted owls, among others.
