The River Ganges leaves the Himalayan foothills and enters the plains at Rishikesh. It is therefore an important place to Hindus and for Hindu practices, and so has many temples, ashrams, and yoga institutes. The city itself is busy and congested, but a much more tranquil atmosphere can be found on, and around, the banks of the river. Rishikesh is easily explored on your own, on foot.
