Himalayan Hideaway is tucked away in a bend of the road that leads away from the busy town of Rishikesh. This small hotel consists of stone cottages, designed to offer space and privacy. Each room has a sit-out with views of the river or forest, and there is a lovely, peaceful atmosphere, overlaid with the sound of the river rushing below, a great spot for birding and drinking in the views.
