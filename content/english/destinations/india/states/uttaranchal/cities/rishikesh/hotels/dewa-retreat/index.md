A new, modern hotel close to the River Ganges and the Laxman Jhula bridge. The rooms are large, well furnished, and many have balconies. There is a small garden, a swimming pool, and, best of all, a fabulous organic caf√©, Pure Soul, serving some of the best vegetarian food in Rishikesh. There are free yoga lessons every morning.
