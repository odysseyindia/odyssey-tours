This large property has the best location in Rishikesh, above the River Ganges at the northern end of the town, facing the hills. The best views are from the infinity swimming pool and the patio cafe, which offers highly imaginative vegetarian dishes. The rooms are large and well-equipped, as many were originally designed to be individual apartments. This family-friendly place offers lots of space and plenty of free activities.
