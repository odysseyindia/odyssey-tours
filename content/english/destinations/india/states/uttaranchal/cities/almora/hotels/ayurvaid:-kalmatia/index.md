As the name suggests, this is an ayurveda-based health retreat, specialising in root-cause treatments in the form of diets, herbal medicine, yoga, massage therapies and more, tailored to individual patients and the seasons. However, it's also a great base for exploring the lovely Kumaon hills, with attractive, cosy cottages, great views, its own herbal garden and a relaxing, serene atmosphere.
