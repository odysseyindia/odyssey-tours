In a very central location, the small entrance and staircase - off the main market street - does little to prepare you for the grandeur of the building above. There is a verandah overlooking the busy ghat and river below, a lovely place to sit. The rooms are large, and some feature antique furniture. There is a restaurant, and the hotel offers various activities to help you to get the most out of your stay in Haridwar.
