  - Watch the spectacular daily Aarti ceremony at sunset
---
Promenades, river channels and bridges create a pleasant riverfront ambience, with the major ghats and religious activities clustered around Har-ki-Pairi. Non-Hindus are not allowed onto this ghat, but the island opposite it, topped by a clock tower, provides an excellent vantage point. You can ask the hotel to send a guide along with you to visit this place.    At dusk, the spectacular daily Aarti ceremony is performed, drawing a crowd of thousands onto the islands and ridges. Candles on lotus petals are floated down the river, and priests perform rituals, swinging torches to the accompaniment of gongs and music.
