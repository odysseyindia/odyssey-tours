Nalagarh is a perfect stop on the way from Chandigarh towards the Kulu valley. This scruffy town has a splendid fort, originally built in the 15th century, but today converted into a heritage hotel. Overlooking the Punjab plains, the Nalagarh Fort is on a hillock at the foothills of the mighty Himalayas, affording a panoramic view of the Shivalik Hills beyond the Sirsa river.
