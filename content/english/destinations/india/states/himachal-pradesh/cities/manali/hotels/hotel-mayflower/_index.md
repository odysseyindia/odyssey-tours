Built in the style of a wooden lodge, this well-run place has an easy charm. Ideally located between New and Old Manali, and backed by pine forests, the tastefully decorated wood-paneled rooms are exceedingly spacious, comfortable and homely.     Log fires can be arranged to heat the rooms in winter, when there is often an open fire in the dining room too. The breakfast here is a highlight, with a wide variety of locally produced jams.
