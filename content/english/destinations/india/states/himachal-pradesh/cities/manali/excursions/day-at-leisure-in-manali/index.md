Manali is famous for its brightly embroidered shawls and caps, its freshly caught trout and its apple orchards. It is an excellent place for long walks and treks in flower-covered valleys and up through pine and cedar forests. Though a profusion of hotels and shops in recent years has overrun downtown Manali, its environs still retain much of the natural beauty that gives this hill station a unique flavour.     Do not miss Old Manali Village and Vasisht spring water sulphur baths and its resident population of hippies. You can also visit the Hadimba and Manu temples for a taste of temple architecture, sample the famous Himachali fruit and drive to Naggar to see Himalayan landscapes as visualised by Russian painter and philosopher Nicholas Roerich.
