The Johnson Hotel and Cafe is a century-old institution in Manali. The older part of the hotel, which houses the cottages, was built back in the early 1900s by Colonel Johnson, and even today the hotel and cafe is owned and run by his descendants. The cottages have a wooden porch and balcony, and are furnished in the English country style. Their speciality trout restaurant is, however, the crowd puller.
