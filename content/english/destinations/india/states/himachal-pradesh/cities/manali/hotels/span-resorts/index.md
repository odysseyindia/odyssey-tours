A comfortable modern hotel in a lovely river-side location. The 25 rooms are divided in 8 cottages spread around the gardens overlooking the river. Each room has a private sit-out from where to watch the spectacular views. There is a trout hatchery close by which ensures fruitful fishing! The resort can also organise horse rides.
