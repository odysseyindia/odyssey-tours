The medieval village of Pragpur has wonderful cobbled streets and slate-roofed houses - it is the first notified heritage village in India. It nestles in one of the most spectacular areas of the Kangra valley, south of Dharamsala. Kangra was the most important kingdom in the West Himalayas after Kashmir and is said to have existed since Vedic times. Steeped in history, Kangra is world famous for the Kangra school of painting.
