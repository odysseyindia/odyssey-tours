  - Kangra-Palampur toy train
---
The Kangra toy train is a hidden gem: one of the last narrow-gauge railways built in India, it mainly gets locals from small towns to temples, through spectacular landscapes in the Himalayan foothills. Think deep gorges, pine forests, fields of yellow mustard. Think undulating tea gardens, jade rivers, mud-walled houses in ochre and green, ears of corn drying on slate roofs. Think pink cherry trees, red headscarves in a sea of green as women tend glistening fields of paddy. Then imagine the snowy white teeth of the Dhauladhar range - and you have the Kangra railway.
