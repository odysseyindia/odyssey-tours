One of Shimla's oldest hotels and the nostalgically cherished first hotel of the now impressive Oberoi Hotel, Clarke's is a quaint, mock Tudor building situated right on Shimla's famous Mall Road.     While the facade of the hotel still looks very much like it did in 1898 when it was built, the rooms have been refurbished and brought upto modern standards, all the while preserving the atmosphere of a old world grace and regality.     There is a sunny terrace with views of the Shimla valley and Shimla's main promenade is just outside your doorstep.
