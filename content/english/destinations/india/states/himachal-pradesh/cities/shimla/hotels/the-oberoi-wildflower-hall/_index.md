A fabulous resort which was once the residence of Lord Kitchener. Tastefully done, all the rooms offer unsurpassed views of the Himalayas outside. Burma teak floors, hand knotted rugs and glorious views of the valley - thats the stuff the Wildflower Hall's rooms are made of. Tapestry covered round, scroll armed sofas and elegant woodbacked chairs. The beds are king size with twisted wooden posts.
