Declared by many to be the finest house in Shimla, Chapslee was once the summer residence of the Raja of Kapurthala. Now it is the home of his grandson who has generously opened the doors of this historic house to guests.     Chapslee only has 6 rooms and staying here feels much like being special invitee in a royal home.    This pretty, single storeyed, ivy covered bungalow is always suffused with sunlight that spills onto the blue Persian rugs, the elegant wooden staircase lined with hunting trophies and the vast collection of Victoriana.
