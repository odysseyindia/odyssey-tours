A contemporary style resort a short distance away from chattering crowds of Shimla's Mall Road, Eastbourne Resorts boasts of having the largest hotel rooms in the city.     However, neither overwhelmingly large nor impersonal and plasticky, this is hotel with a lot of class and character of its own, built like a group  of stone cottages with pointed roofs.     Rooms look out upon the fragrant rose garden below and beyond, to the conical heads of oak and pine trees extending down the hill slopes.
