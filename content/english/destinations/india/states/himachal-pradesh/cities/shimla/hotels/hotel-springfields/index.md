A small, atmospheric heritage hotel with spacious rooms, situated in peaceful and verdant surroundings in Chhota Shimla, a 20-minute, mostly traffic free, walk from the Mall. Being a heritage property, the rooms vary in size, but they all feature classical furniture: large wooden beds, carved cupboards, vivid carpets, and overstuffed armchairs. There is a comfortable lounge and a garden with views over the surrounding hills.
