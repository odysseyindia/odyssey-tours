This most famous of hill stations was developed by the British in the 19th century as the summer capital of India. Now the capital of Himachal Pradesh, the town has continued to grow, but at its heart remains the Mall, lined with colonial-era buildings. There are many beautiful walks in the pine clad hills that surround Shimla, such as to the Jakhu temple, or to the former Viceregal Lodge with its botanical gardens.
