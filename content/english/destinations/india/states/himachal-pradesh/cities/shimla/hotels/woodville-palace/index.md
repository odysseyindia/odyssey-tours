An elegant, old-fashioned, 1930s mansion on the peaceful western side of Shimla, with comfortable rooms, period furniture, and lawns. The main building at Woodville Palace is full of character with beautiful wood-paneled walls, sweeping staircases, and portraits of Maharajas, weapons and hunting trophies, with a traditional and atmospheric bar, lounge and formal dining area. The gardens are also very pleasant. It is a fairly flat 15-minute, mostly traffic-free, walk to the Mall.
