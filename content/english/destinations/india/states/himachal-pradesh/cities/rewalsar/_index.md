Called the confluence of religions for its importance to both Buddhism and Sikhism, the town of Rewalsar is built around the deep green waters of its lake. Cradled by mountains, the lake has inspired legends such as that of Padmasambhava, in which a local princess is said to have fallen in love with him. Her angry father condemned them to death by burning, a fire that left behnd not ashes but the tranquil waters of the lake.
