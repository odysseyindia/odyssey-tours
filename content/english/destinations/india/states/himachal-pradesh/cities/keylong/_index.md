Keylong is an overnight halt during the 2-day trip between Leh and Manali. This is the second-highest motorable road in the world, reaching a dizzying altitude of 5,328 metres at Tanglang La. Its surfaces vary wildly, from bumpy asphalt to dirt tracks sliced by glacial streams, running through a starkly beautiful lunar wilderness, inhabited only by nomadic shepherds and soldiers.
