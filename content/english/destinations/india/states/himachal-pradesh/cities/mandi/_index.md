The historic town of Mandi is built along the banks of the river Beas. This one-time capital of the princely state of Mandi is a fast-developing town that still retains much of its original charm and character. Mandi is renowned for its 81 stone temples and their enormous range of fine carving, and is often called the 'Varanasi of the Hills'. The town has the remains of old palaces and notable colonial buildings.
