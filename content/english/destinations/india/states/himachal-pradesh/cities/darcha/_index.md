Darcha is one of the overnight halts during the 3 day journey on the 485km road between Leh and Manali. This is an extraordinary journey on the second highest motorable road in the world, usually open only from early June to mid October, climbing as high as 5328 metres at the Taglang La pass. As a seasonal tented camp the facilities at Darcha could hardly be described as anything but simply functional, but the beauty of the surroundings and the experience of undertaking such a magnificent road journey are compensation enough for the hardships endured en route.
