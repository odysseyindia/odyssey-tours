Katrain, in the widest part of the Kullu Valley mid-way between Kullu and Manali, is overlooked by Baragarh Peak. It is an area of beautiful deodars, horse chestnuts and fruit orchards. On the other side of the Beas river is Naggar, which used to be the capital of Kullu valley for nearly 1500 years. The 500-year-old, timber-built Naggar castle has stunning views over the valley. Nearby one can visit the  house of the late professor Nicholas Roerich whose art works are still on display here. Also of interest at the bottom of the castle is a grey sandstone Shiva Temple dating back to the 11th or 12th century.
