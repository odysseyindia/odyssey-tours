The town of Palampur is situated in an idyllic valley of tea gardens, and is surrounded by hills covered with pine trees. The place enjoys a year-round pleasant climate and the pine scented air is said to have curative properties. Overlooking this town are the majestic Dhauladhars, whose peaks remain covered with snow for most of the year.     There are several pleasant walks around the town. A short walk from here takes one to the awe inspiring Bundla Chasm which has a fall of over 100 meters to the Bundla stream. The stream is a thin streak running over stony ground far below the cliff. During the monsoon season, it swells and rages madly over the entire width of the chasm taking stones and boulders along with it.     Close to Palampur is the artists' village of Andretta. Created by Norah Richards, an affectionately remembered patron of Punjabi theatre, this 'village' has grown over the years to include writers, potters, and theatre artists.
