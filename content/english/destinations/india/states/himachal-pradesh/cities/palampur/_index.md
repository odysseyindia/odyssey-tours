The town of Palampur came into being when a British doctor introduced the tea bush from Almora in 1849. The bush thrived and so did the town which became a focus of the European tea estate owners. Nowadays Palampur is a lovely town surrounded by tea gardens and pine trees. Behind the town stand the majestic high ranges of the Dhauladhars, whose peaks remain covered in snow for most part of the year.
