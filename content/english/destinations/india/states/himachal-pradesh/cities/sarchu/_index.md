Sarchu and Jispa are overnight halts on the famous highway between Manali and Leh, which opened to foreigners only in 1989. This is the second-highest motorable road in the world, reaching a dizzying altitude of 5,328 metres at Tanglang La. Its surfaces vary wildly, from bumpy asphalt to dirt tracks sliced by glacial streams, running through a starkly beautiful lunar wilderness, inhabited only by nomadic shepherds and soldiers.
