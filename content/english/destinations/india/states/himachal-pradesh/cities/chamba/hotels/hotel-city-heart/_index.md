Located at a few minutes walk from the bazaar, Hotel City Heart is modern and well maintained.     Some rooms offer good views of the grassy maidan that forms the centre of Chamba, and of the mountains beyond.     The restaurant is probably the only dining option in town and is located in a simple dining room with large windows overlooking the city.
