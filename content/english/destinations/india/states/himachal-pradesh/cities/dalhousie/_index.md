Dalhousie is known for its bracing climate, picturesque scenery and beautiful picnic spots. Named after Lord Dalhousie it was frequented during the British Raj by those who could not make it to Shimla during the summer months. Like Dharamsala, it also has a resident Tibetan population. Small shrines and the local colourful Tibetan markets make it worth one's while to stop here for a few days.
