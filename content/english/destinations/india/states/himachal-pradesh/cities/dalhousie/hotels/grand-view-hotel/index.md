The Grand View Hotel is one of the few standing buildings in Dalhousie that still evoke the grace and grandeur of this erstwhile British retreat. The building has a long wooden facade complete with the original fretwork and gabled roofs that faces panoramic views of the majestic Pir Panjal snow peaks in the distance. There is a large sunny dining area that serves steaming hot Indian food, perfect to warm your insides after a walk along the nearby Mall.
