A charming small guest house in the peaceful estate of an old colonial house. The five independent cottages are modern and spacious, each with a small living area as well as private facilities.     The rough hewed stone cottages seem to have always been a part of these mountains. On the inside they are warmly decorated using large amounts of deodar wood cut from trees from the property itself. There is a verandah with superb views over the mountains.
