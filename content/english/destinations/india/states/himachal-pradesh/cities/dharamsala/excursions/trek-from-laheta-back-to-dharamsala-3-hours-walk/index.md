First we walk on a grassy ridge with fine views of Dhauladhar and Kangra valley. After two hours walk on a ridge we descend downhill on a steep trail that takes us to waterfall near Bhagsu village. Lunch near the river. Another 20 minutes walk takes us to Bhagsu village from where we walk 1 km on the road to Mcleod Ganj where your trek ends.
