Dharamsala is a hill station that was established by the British in the mid-19th century. It stands on a spur of the Dhauladhar range amidst magnificent deodar and pine forests, tea gardens and beautiful hills. Today Upper Dharamsala, known as Mcleod Ganj, is the home of the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan Government-in-Exile. It is therefore the best base to explore Tibetan Buddhism, history and culture.
