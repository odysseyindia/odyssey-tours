Popular with sophisticated travellers, high level monks and business delegations alike, the Surya McLeod stands out as one the most professionally run hotels in Dharamsala.    The rooms have wood or carpet covered floors, large, soft beds, tall windows with grand views, tea and coffee makers and modern bathrooms with hot water in the mornings and evenings.     The restaurant serves a range of cuisines and the bar is probably the best stocked in town.
