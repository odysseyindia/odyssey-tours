Perfectly located in the heart of McLeod Ganj, Serkong House also offers stunning panoramic views of the Kangra Valley. The rooms are decorated in a charming Tibetan style, and the hotel also has an interesting library/ lounge in which to learn about this culture. Rooms are accented with beautiful pieces handmade at Norbulingka Institute including carved wooden lamps, organic cotton bedcovers, and cushion covers.
