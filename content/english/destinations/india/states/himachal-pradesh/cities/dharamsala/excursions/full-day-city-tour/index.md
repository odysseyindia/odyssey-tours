There is much to see in and around Dharamsala. On a full-day guided tour you can visit the Dalai Lama's temple and join the Tibetan pilgrims on their traditional "kora" (circuit of the temple complex). You can see the buildings that make up the Tibetan Parliament, including the library/museum. Surprisingly close to the town, you can walk through tea plantations and visit a functioning tea factory.     In Lower Dharamsala you can visit the fascinating Norbulingka Institute, a large complex dedicated to the preservation of Tibetan culture, with many workshops producing Tibetan handicrafts, a colourful temple, and a peaceful garden caf√©. You can enjoy extensive views of the hills and mountains above Dharamsala, and take a short walk through a traditional village belonging to the Gaddi people, and visit the 19th-century St John in the Wilderness church.
