A large, modern resort in the hills around Dharamsala, this hotel offers stunning views, especially from the lobby, which also contains a pastry counter/ coffee shop. Divided across three blocks named for local peaks, like the Riflehorn, the Fortune Park Moksha has a large number of rooms, a restaurant with a great view, a pool, a yoga centre and a games/activity area, and works well for families and anyone who wants to explore the local Gaddi shepherd village.
