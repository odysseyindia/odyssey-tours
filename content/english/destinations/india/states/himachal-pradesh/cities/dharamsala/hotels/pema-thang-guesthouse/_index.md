Away from the noise of the central square and yet only a stone's throw from it, the very likable Pema Thang Guesthouse has spotless and tasteful rooms with cream walls and polished wood floors.     The hotel is run by a family of Tibetan singers and restaurateurs - their experiences in owning restaurants in Paris and Amsterdam ensuring that Pema Thang's food - both European and Tibetan is excellent.
