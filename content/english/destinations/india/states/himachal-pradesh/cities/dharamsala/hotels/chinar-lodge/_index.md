Chinar Lodge is situated just walking distance from the Dalai Lama's main temple, in a peaceful and quiet part of town. The hotel is small with just nine rooms which guarantees a more personal stay. All rooms have wall-to-wall carpet, satelite colour TV and attached bathroom with hot and cold water. There is 24 hour room service and both telephone and laundry services are also available. The snow-capped mountain view is breathtaking and the birdlife is prolific.
