A pretty country house set amongst endless acres of tea gardens and private forest, the White Haven Estate is a short 15 minute drive from Upper Dharamsala's temples and bazaars.     It is perfect for travellers who wish to add the experience of living on a small tea estate to their visit to Dharamsala.    White Haven was built in the mid 19th century by intrepid British travellers. It was recently converted into a high end hideaway by its present owners.
