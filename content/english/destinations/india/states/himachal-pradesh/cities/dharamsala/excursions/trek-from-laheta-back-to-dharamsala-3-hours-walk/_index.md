First, we walk on a grassy ridge with fine views of the Dhauladhar range and Kangra valley. After two hours' walk on this ridge, we descend on a steep trail that takes us to waterfall near Bhagsu village. Lunch is a picnic by the river. Another 20 minutes' walk takes us to Bhagsu village, from where we walk 1km on the road to McLeod Ganj, where your trek ends. You can then continue your tour from here.
