Drive from McLeod Ganj to Satobari, the starting point of the trek. From Satobari it is downhill walk passing through Barnet village to Ghera village where we have lunch near the river. From Ghera it is steep ascent for about two hours to Kareri village (1900m), a Gaddi tribal village with about 40 to 50 houses. We camp here near a small stream.
