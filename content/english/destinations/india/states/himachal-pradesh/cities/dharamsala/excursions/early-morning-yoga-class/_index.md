Between April and October, you can join a morning yoga class. You will learn various breathing exercises (pranayamas) and some basic yoga positions (asanas), a good introduction to yoga. The classes usually take place from 8am to 9.30am, after which you return to the hotel for a well-earned late breakfast. Note that if you travel to Dharamsala between November and March it is unlikely that the yoga classes will be operating.
