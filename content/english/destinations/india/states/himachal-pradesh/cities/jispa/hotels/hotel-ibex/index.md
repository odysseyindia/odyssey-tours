Hotel Ibex is located in the small village of Jispa, on the banks of the River Bhaga, a tributary of the great Chenab River, and boasts great views over the valley and the mountains beyond. The rooms are simple, but clean, and there is plenty of hot water in the en-suite bathrooms. The welcoming restaurant serves hearty local dishes, and packed lunches are provided on departure for the following day's long drive.
