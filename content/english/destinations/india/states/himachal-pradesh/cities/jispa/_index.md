A small village situated in a valley, Jispa is a convenient place to break the long but spectacular journey between Manali and Leh. Its low altitude helps with acclimatization and its handful of hotels offer acceptable accommodation. Aside from the fields of potatoes and peas there are few signs of habitation, but the views of the valley are spectacular - fields of red and yellow wildflowers watered by the Bhaga River.
