The best way to see Shimla is on foot, visiting the Botanical Gardens and lovely Viceregal Lodge, then descending along traffic-free roads through little forests and past colonial-era buildings to the Oberoi Cecil, Shimla's grandest building. From here you can visit the Ridge, a large open area bordered by the peaceful Christ Church and Gaiety Theatre, and the Mall, Shimla's colourful shopping hub, uniquely colonial and very different from a typical Indian bazaar. Please note that both the Viceregal Lodge and Gaiety Theatre are closed on Mondays.    This is an easy, flexible walking tour that allows you as much or as little time at each spot, and even plenty of stops at cafes like the iconic Indian Coffee House. A car is available to take you to the Viceregal Lodge and pick you up from the Mall at the end of the tour.
