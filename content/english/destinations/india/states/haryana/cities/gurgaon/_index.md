Gurgaon, a new satellite town just south of Delhi, has grown extensively during the last two decades. It has become one of the most prominent outsourcing hubs in South Asia. The outsourcing boom has led to a demographic shift to a younger, more cosmopolitan, more affluent and better-educated population. This in turn has stimulated a mushrooming of shopping malls, swank restaurants and entertainment facilities.
