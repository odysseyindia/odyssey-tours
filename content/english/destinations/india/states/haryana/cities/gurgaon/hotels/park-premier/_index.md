This ultra-modern hotel has a spanking white lobby, set off by splashes of colour provided by plush cushions, curtains and flowers floating in marble urns.     On the mezzanine floor, overlooking the lobby are the two restaurants; a coffee shop and a specialty grill restaurant.    The rooms are exceedingly well appointed - with the highest quality of furnishing and beddings and judicious use of colour.
