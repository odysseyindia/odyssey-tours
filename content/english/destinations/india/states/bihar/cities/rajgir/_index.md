Surrounded by rugged, forested hills, the town of Rajgir is important for Buddhists as well as Jains as the founders of both religions spent many years meditating and preaching here. Gridhrakuta ("Vultures Peak") is a site much venerated by Buddhists, as this is where the Buddha delivered many important sermons. Two rock-cut caves here were a favourite retreat of the Buddha.
