Vaishali dates back to the 6th century BC when it was a flourishing city, reputedly one of the first democratic republics. This is where the Buddha preached his last sermon and announced his approaching Nirvana. Vaishali today is a small village surrounded by banana and mango groves and rice fields. At the site of Buddha's last sermon, the Emperor Ashoka erected a pillar which still stands, surrounded by ruined monasteries.
