Nalanda was the site of the world's earliest university, where 2,000 teachers and 10,000 students from all over the Buddhist world lived and studied from the 5th century BC till the 12th century AD. Much still lies unexcavated, but even so, Nalanda's scale and grandeur is evident from the ruins of the stupas, temples and monasteries. There is also a small but interesting archaeological museum of finds from the site.
