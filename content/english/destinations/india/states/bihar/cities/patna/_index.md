In ancient times Patna, then known as Pataliputra, was renowned as one of the great cities of Asia, but today it is a congested urban sprawl, stretching along the banks of the Ganges. Divided in two by the large open Maidan, the area to the west, laid out by the British, still boasts gracious mansions and administrative buildings, while the area to the east includes the crowded old city with its bazaars and old mosques.
