The Danish settlement of Serampore lines the west bank of the Hooghly and was originally known as Frederiknagore, after the Danish monarch. Sold to the East India Company in 1845 Serampore developed into an important missionary town and printing centre. Today you can explore Seramporeâ€™s churches, temples and government buildings as well as the library of Serampore College which houses a rare collection of Sanskrit, Tibetan and Pali manuscripts.
