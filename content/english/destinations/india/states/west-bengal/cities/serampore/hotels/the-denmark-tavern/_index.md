This 232-year-old two-storied structure by the banks of the Hooghly was a tavern and hotel where the Danes kept their flagstaff and cannons. It took around two years to restore the tavern to its former glory, and is now a very attractive hotel, with a cafe attached. Inside you'll find a cosy colonial ambience and lovely, high-ceilinged rooms with the hotel's pretty green shutters.
