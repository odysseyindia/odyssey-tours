A former French colony that remained in the possession of France until 1950, Chandernagore has a lovely setting on the banks of the Hooghly River and the churches, convents and buildings here are reminiscent of the colonial French era. The former governor's mansion on the pleasant riverfront road, now called the Cultural Institut de Chandarnagar, has an interesting museum explaining colonial history on the Hooghly, and contains the four-poster bed of 18th-century governor Joseph Dupleix.  You can also visit the nearby 18th century missionary church, Ã‰glise du Sacre Coeur.
