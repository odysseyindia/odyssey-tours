Discover tranquility in Kurseong. Often you can look down on the clouds below, like the sea, stretching for miles, filling the valleys and the peaks. Ranges rise out of it like islands and peninsulas. Kurseong is home to world-famous tea gardens which produce the most delicate aromas of all black teas. There is a daily toy train service (since 1890) that runs from Kurseong to Darjeeling.
