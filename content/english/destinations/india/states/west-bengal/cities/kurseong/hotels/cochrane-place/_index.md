On the outskirts of Kurseong is Cochrane Place, a beautifully restored stately British colonial home.    Nestled in the foothills of the Himalayas with awe-inspiring views of the majestic Kanchenjunga, Cochrane Place is surrounded by the aroma of the finest Darjeeling tea.    The buildings of stone, log and cast iron, regal antique furniture and colonial cuisine, give the hotel a Raj ambiance.
