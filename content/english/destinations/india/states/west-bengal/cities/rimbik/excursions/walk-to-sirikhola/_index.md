Today you drive from Darjeeling to Rimbik (70km/4 hrs), a small village on the edge of Shingalilla National Park. Here starts the Shingalilla Ridge Trek, a classic trek in the Himalayas. Today you walk 2 hours to the village of Sirikhola where you spend the night in a local lodge. Along the way you have beautiful views of the highest mountains of the Himalayas, Mt. Kangchenjunga, Mt. Everest, Mt. Makalu and Mt. Lhotse. You pass various small villages and you get a good impression of the local culture.
