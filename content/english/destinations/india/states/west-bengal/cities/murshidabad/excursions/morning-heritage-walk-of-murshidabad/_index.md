Murshidabad is replete with history and the abandoned mosques, riverside mansions, grand tombs and crumbling palaces tell the story of an undivided Bengal. You explore Murshidabad on a heritage walk that includes the imposing Hazarduari Palace, neighbouring Imambara, 17th century Jahankosha Canon, the 200 year old palace of wealthy financier Jagat Seth, Katra Mosque, Khoshbagh gardens and Kathgola, the home of a rich Jain merchant.
