The lovely Bari Kothi was built in the late 1700s, one of the most architecturally significant houses in the region, showcasing Greek, Roman and French architecture. Like other mansions in the region, it was abandoned for half a century, but restored in 2015 as a luxury heritage hotel, intended to employ local workers and craftsmen. The richly-decorated suites contain 150-year-old furniture, and each has its own history.
