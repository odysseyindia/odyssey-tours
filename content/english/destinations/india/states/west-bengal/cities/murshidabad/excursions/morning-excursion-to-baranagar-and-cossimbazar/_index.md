First visit the fascinating terracotta temples at Baranagar then continue on to Cossimbazar which was once a Dutch colony and busy inland river port throughout the 18th and 19th centuries. During the early days of its existence, the English, Dutch and French all had factories in Cossimbazar and the town soon developed a reputation for silk, hosiery and ivory. A highlight is the palatial Cossimbazar Rajbari, still owned by the family which built it, and which today also houses an interesting museum.
