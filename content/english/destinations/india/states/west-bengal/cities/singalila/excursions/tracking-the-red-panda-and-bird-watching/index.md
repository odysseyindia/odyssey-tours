  - Tracking the Red Panda and bird watching
---
During your stay first preference is given to Red Panda sightings and you are therefore asked to stay close to Habre's Nest. All the trackers will be out looking for Red Panda during daylight with necessary breaks. In case of sightings, you will start your journey with all the necessary field support.     In the meantime, you can enjoy bird sightings close to the lodge and wait for the call and stay close. You can also use the in-house Bird Studio for staying hidden and watching or documenting elusive Himalayan wildlife. This bird hide hosted 45-50 different species over the years .    The afternoon is generally affected by bad weather so depending on the situation you can choose whatâ€™s best to do.
