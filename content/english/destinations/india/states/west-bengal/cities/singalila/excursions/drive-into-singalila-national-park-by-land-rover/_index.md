You drive by road to Manebhanjang, the gateway town for Singalila National Park. Here, you will shift into historic Land Rovers for a two-hour drive through the forest; these 70-year-old vehicles make your journey fun and interesting as you make your way through rhododendron copses to Habre's Nest.
