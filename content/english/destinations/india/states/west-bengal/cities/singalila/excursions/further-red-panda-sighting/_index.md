Today is another opportunity to follow the trail of a Red Panda, accompanied by an experienced wildlife tracker.    


Enjoy the early morning views of the enchanting Himalayas with a cup of morning tea and afterwards try to get a glimpse of the many Eastern Himalayan birds - including red billed leothrix, chestnut neaded tesia and blood pheasant. Mammals that you may spot  include Himalayan black bear, muntjac deer, pangolin, wild boar and, not very often, leopard.    


All the while you wait for a call of the trackers to join them for a Red Panda sighting!
