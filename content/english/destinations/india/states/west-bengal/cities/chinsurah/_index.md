The Dutch East India Company established their base, Fort Gustavus, at Chinsurah, 5km north of Chandernagore.  They ruled here from the early 17th century till 1825 when Chinsurah was finally ceded to the British. Fort Gustavas was demolished to make room for extensive barracks, now used as the Court Building. The Armenian Church of St John (1690s) is the most prominent Dutch-era monument. The few traces of the Dutch themselves include a wall of Fort Gustavus attached to the Hooghly Madrasa, and a Dutch Cemetery.
