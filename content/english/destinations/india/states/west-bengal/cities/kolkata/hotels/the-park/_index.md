Cool, classy and cutting edge is The Park Calcutta. From their deep purple and black lobby that oozes oomph to their full service spa and massage centre that soothes upon entering it to their carefully crafted rooms and mind boggling range of eateries, The Park Calcutta is all about opulence and over the top luxury.     A padded and perfumed world, The Park can make you forget the dusty Calcutta that throbs outside its very doors, so enter here for a dose of escapism at its most sophisticated.
