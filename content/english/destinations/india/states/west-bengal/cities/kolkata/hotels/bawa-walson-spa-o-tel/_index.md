Amongst the simple "backpacker" hostels on Sudder Street, this new boutique style hotel stands out. The Buddhist artifacts, and plants, scattered through the hotel, and in the rooms, help to create a tranquil atmosphere of calm.     There is a small restaurant, with a pleasant outdoor sitting area, and the large spa is set to become a major attraction.
