Kolkata has fascinating street life and interesting colonial architecture. You drive via the historic St John's Church to the famous Dalhousie Square, the commercial centre of the city, now renamed BBD Bagh. From here you continue to the bank of the river Hoogly, where you see the famous Howrah Bridge, which more than 5 million people cross every day. You also visit the colourful flower market.     


Next is the Karmatuly area, where they make the huge effigies used in Kolkata's most famous festival, Durga Puja. To the North of the centre you visit the exquisite, richly decorated Jain Temple before continuing to College Street book market, with its hundreds of bookstalls, and finally enjoy a coffee at the famous Indian Coffee House - still a gathering place for the city's intellectuals.
