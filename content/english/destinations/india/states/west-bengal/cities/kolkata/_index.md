Kolkata was just a tiny village some 300 years ago. After the East India Company made it their first base in India, Calcutta became the seat of British power in India, and developed into an economic, industrial and political centre. At its chaotic heart is the Maidan, a huge green expanse with gardens, monuments and sporting facilities. At one end stands the Victoria Memorial, a white marble building that provides one of the best insights into British rule in India.
