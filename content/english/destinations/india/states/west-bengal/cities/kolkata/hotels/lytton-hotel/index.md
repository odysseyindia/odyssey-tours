Although The Lytton is undeniably a business hotel, it has a definite warmth and ambience. Perhaps the atmosphere is due to its colourful history: the building was originally used as a nursing home during the Second World War before it was converted into a hotel by a Briton whose name the hotel still bears. Today, there are charming rooms of yellow and white, specialty restaurants, and a chic red and black bar.
