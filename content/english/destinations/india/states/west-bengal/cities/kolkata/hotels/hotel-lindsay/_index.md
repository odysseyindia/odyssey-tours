This hotel has a superb location, directly opposite the historic New Market. The rooms are spread over 7 floors of the tall, narrow building, and, though space is obviously at a premium in such a desirable location, they are well equipped. The bar, restaurant, and rooftop terrace on the 9th floor offer an unbeatable view over the city.
