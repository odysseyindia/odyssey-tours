The zamindars or landed gentry of Bengal led a lavish life full of wealth and privileges, building impressive mansions and temples. One such mansion is the Rajbari Bawali, over 250 years old and now a very comfortable heritage hotel, with gorgeous four-poster beds, etched mirrors and beautiful common areas (including a swimming pool) in an olde-worlde setting near the Hooghly River.
