This heritage hotel is owned by descendants of David Macdonald who, as British Trade Agent, helped the Dalai Lhama escape from Tibet in 1910. It was here that he wrote "Land of the Lhama" and "Twenty Years in Tibet".     The Heritage Rooms have a nostalgic ambience - rose motifs cover the bedspreads and curtains and sturdy armchairs face the working fireplaces. The new Annexe Rooms may not bear the same imprint of British country life but they tend to be brighter, with larger windows and balconies.
