Before the Chinese takeover of Tibet, Kalimpong was the centre of India's wool trade with that country, with Tibetan caravans winding their way down from the Tibetan plateau to trade wool for manufactured goods. Even today, Kalimpong is home to diverse communities, and a short walk reveals temples, monasteries, churches and mosques. Kalimpong is also a centre for bird watching, hikes, and world-famous flower nurseries.
