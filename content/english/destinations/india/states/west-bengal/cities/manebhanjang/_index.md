Manebhanjang is a small town, 28 km away from Darjeeling. It is the entry point for Singalila National Park. You’ll meet the Habre’s Nest guide here and after getting entry permission you will travel by a classic Land Rover to the Base Camp at Kaiakata, right on the Indian-Nepalese border, where you check-in at Habre’s Nest.
