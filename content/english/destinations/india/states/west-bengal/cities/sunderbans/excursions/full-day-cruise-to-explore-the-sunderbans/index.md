  - Full day cruise to explore the Sunderbans
---
You take an early-morning cruise towards the the Sudhayakhali and Dobanke Watch Towers as you move into the Sunderban Tiger Reserve Forest through creeks and dense forest and numerous rivers. With a little luck one may spot a sun-bathing salt-water crocodile. This area is most famously home to the Royal Bengal Tiger, which can be spotted from strategically-placed watchtowers, but they're very shy and usually well-hidden.     You are more likely to see an immense variety of birds, like the heron, egret, cormorant, fishing eagle, white-bellied sea eagle, seagull, tern and kingfisher as well as migratory birds like whimbrel, black-tailed godwit, little stint, eastern knot, curlew, sandpiper, golden plover, pintail, white-eyed pochard and whistling teal.     During your cruise you visit the Sudhanyakhali watchtower and take a canopy walk at Dobanki as you move into the Sunderban Tiger Reserve Forest through creeks and dense forest and numerous rivers. The canopy walk at Dobanki Watch Tower inside the forest gives you a 360-degree view of the forest. Lunch will be served on board. You return to the camp by sundown. In the evening, you can enjoy a dinner in the camp.
