---
After a hot lunch on arrival at the resort, you will board the boat for a birding and game cruise to the Sajnekhali Watchtower and Mangrove Interpretation Centre. As the sun sets over the distant horizon, you return to the resort to refresh and enjoy tea with snacks with infotainment by our poacher-turned-guides. A warm dinner cooked with farm-fresh vegetables is served at the dining hall.
