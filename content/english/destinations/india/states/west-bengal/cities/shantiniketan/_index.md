The educational center of Shantiniketan ('abode of peace') was founded by Rabindranath Tagore in the early 20th century. Tagore was a great writer, artist, songwriter, educationalist and 1913 Nobel literature laureate and his vision and immense talent inspired a whole way of life and art. The university and school still operate under this momentum and attract thousands of Indian and international students, with classes still held in the open air under the campus trees.
