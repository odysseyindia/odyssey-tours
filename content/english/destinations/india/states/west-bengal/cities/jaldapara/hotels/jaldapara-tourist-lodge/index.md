  - Jaldapara Tourist Lodge
---
The only place to stay in Jaldapara. Built on timber on stilts deep inside the sanctuary, 6 km from Madarihat, this Government-run forest lodge offers 7 rooms on full board basis. The lodge is very popular as it is close to the sanctuary and also en route to Phuntsoling in Bhutan so it has to be booked well in advance.
