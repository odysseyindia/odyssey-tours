This park was established in 1943 to protect the Indian one-horned rhino. Lying at the foot of the Bhutan hills, not far from Phuntsoling, the sanctuary covers just 115 sq km. The river Torsa flows through it and the sandy river banks have extensive belts of tall grass, best seen on elephant-back. Apart from rhino, there are tiger, gaur, leopard, muntjac, hog deer and elephant, plus birds like the Bengal florican.
