The battlefield of Plassey is where the East India Company, under the command of Robert Clive, defeated the Nawab of Bengal, which laid the foundations for British rule in India. Robert Clive had bribed Mir Jafar who was an aspirant to the throne of Nawab of Bengal, and this betrayal ensured that the battle was over in a few hours with a decisive victory for East India Company. You can visit the house and cemetery of Mir Jafar, a memorial of the darkest hour in the history of Bengal.
