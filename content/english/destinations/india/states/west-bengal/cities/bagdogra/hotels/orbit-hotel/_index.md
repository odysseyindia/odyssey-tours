This is a new and very comfortable hotel with an unusual location on the top floor of the new Orbit Mall. The large deluxe rooms are very stylish, being decorated predominately in white, and would not seem out of place in a chic boutique hotel in a metro city.     There is a very attractive restaurant, and good views over the city and towards the foothills of the Himalayas beyond.
