This pleasant hotel is located in the market town of Bagdogra, which is lively during the day, but is much quieter at night than the nearby town of Siliguri. The rooms are modern and well equipped. There is a restaurant with a peaceful small terrace overlooking a garden, and even a small branch of Glenary's, the most famous coffee house of Darjeeling.
