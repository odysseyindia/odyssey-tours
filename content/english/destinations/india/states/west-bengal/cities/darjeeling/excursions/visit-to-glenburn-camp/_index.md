Today, exploring another part of this vast estate, you walk down to the Glenburn Camp by the River Rangeet. You have the day to relax in this lovely, peaceful spot and swim in the river. You also get a barbecue lunch, followed by a walk across a suspension bridge into the neighbouring state of Sikkim.
