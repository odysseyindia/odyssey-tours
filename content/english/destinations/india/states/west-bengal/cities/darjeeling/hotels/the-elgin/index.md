A well-preserved Victorian mansion dating back to 1885, The Elgin has interiors that are dominated by teak floorboards covered with hand-made Tibetan rugs, comfortably over-stuffed armchairs, and crackling log-fires. The rooms are all charmingly designed with period furniture and many have marble bathrooms and open fire-places.
