The most celebrated of Darjeeling hotels, the Windamere has accommodated a pantheon of rich and famous guests. The Windamere has old-fashioned independent cottages with Raj-period furniture and crackling fireplaces lit at night. The hotel serves traditional English food at meal times and High Tea is accompanied by the hotel's string quartet. The cozy bar is beautiful too.
