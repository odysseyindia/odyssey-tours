You start before dawn for an early morning drive through Ghoom and the woodlands to watch the sunrise from Tiger Hill. This incredible viewpoint, at an altitude of 2585 meters, provides an unparalleled Himalayan panorama, including Everest and Kanchenjunga in clear weather. On the way back to Darjeeling, you stop to visit the old monastery of Ghoom. This is probably the most famous monastery in Darjeeling.
