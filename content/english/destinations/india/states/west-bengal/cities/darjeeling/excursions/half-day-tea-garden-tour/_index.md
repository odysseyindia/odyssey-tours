Darjeeling is the Mecca of tea, producing what we know as the "Champagne of Teas." There are 80-odd operational tea gardens in Darjeeling that span thousands of acres. On this tour you visit one of the tea estates, where you are invited to learn about tea processing in a factory where some of the best teas in the world are withered, rolled, dried, sorted and packaged.
