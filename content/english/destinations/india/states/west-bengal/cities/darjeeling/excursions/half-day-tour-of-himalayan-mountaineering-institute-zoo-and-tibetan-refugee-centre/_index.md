A short distance from Darjeeling is the Zoo, which hosts examples of Himalayan wildlife, including red pandas, yaks, and leopards. Within the zoo grounds is the Himalayan Mountaineering Institute. This has a museum of mountaineering, including a section on Mt Everest. At the nearby Tibetan Refugee Centre, established by the sister of the Dalai Lama, you can observe Tibetan refugees making traditional handicrafts. It is an interesting walk from here around Observatory Hill back to the Darjeeling Mall.      Please note that the HMI and Zoo are closed on Thursday, and the Tibetan Refugee Centre on Sunday.
