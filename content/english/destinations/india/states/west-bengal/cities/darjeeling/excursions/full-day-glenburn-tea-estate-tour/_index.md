Today, you can explore your 1,600-acre private estate with an introduction to the specialised art of growing and crafting Glenburn tea. Visit the tea fields, interact with the tea pickers and follow the journey of "two leaves and bud" into the tea factory, ending with a tea tasting session to discover the incredible variety of flavours and aromas that come from a single bush through the different seasons. A picnic lunch is included.
