You go to Darjeeling to enjoy the atmosphere of the British Raj, the lush green tea plantations, the magnificent views of the Kanchenjunga and the colourful hill people of the Northeastern Himalayas. During the British Raj in India, Darjeeling's temperate climate led to its development as a hill station (hill town) for British residents to escape the heat of the plains during the summers, becoming known as the Summer Capital.
