Dekeling Hotel is a well-situated, friendly and comfortable hotel. Spotlessly clean and simple, this is the place to go for Tibetan hospitality in a Raj ambience. Tiled Victorian fireplaces and polished wooden floors are combined with bright Tibetan decorations. An old iron chimney heater keeps the lounge/library cozy and warm; it's a wonderful place to relax with a book.
