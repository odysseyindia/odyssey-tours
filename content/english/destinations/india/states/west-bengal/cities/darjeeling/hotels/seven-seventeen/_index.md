Conveniently located in the heart of the town, Hotel Seven Seventeen is an inviting 3-star hotel in Darjeeling run by a very hospitable Tibetan family. Apparently all family members were born or passed away on the 7th or 17th of any month of the Gregorian calendar, hence the name Seven Seventeen! All rooms have wall to wall carpeting and attached bathrooms and they are decorated in traditional Tibetan style. The hotel has an excellent restaurant which serves great Tibetan meals.
