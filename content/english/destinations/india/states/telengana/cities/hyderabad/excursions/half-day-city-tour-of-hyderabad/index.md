West of Hyderabad lies the historic Golconda Fort, with its massive battlements winding up the dust-brown hill. First built in the 13th century, this fort was rebuilt by the Qutab Shahis, who made it their capital in 1525, and laid out its splendid monuments and parks, and a famous acoustic system. Nearby are the domed tombs of seven Qutab Shahi kings, silently telling you of the splendor and grandeur of an era gone by.
