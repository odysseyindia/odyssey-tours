The heart of Telangana is the former Muslim-ruled princely state of Hyderabad. The twin cities Hyderabad and Secunderabad, are a mixture of Muslim and Hindu cultures. The old city is found around the famous Charminar gate, and this predominantly Muslim area is fascinating for travellers to explore.

The evidence of Hyderabad's history as the centre of Muslim India from the 16th century onwards can best be seen in the mighty Golconda Fort one of the most impressive forts in India.
