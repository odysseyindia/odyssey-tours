There's plenty to do on Havelock Island: the hotel can organise scuba diving in the utterly gorgeous coral reefs of Mahatma Gandhi Marine National Park, or snorkelling, plus exploring the mangrove forests by kayak, yoga and bird-watching. You can also hire a cycle, go walkabout, or simply relax on the stunning Radhanagar beach and enjoy a peaceful holiday. You can arrange all these activities right at the resort.
