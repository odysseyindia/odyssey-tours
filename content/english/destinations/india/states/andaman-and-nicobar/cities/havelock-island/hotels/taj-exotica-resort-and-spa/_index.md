Occupying 46 acres on the famed Radhanagar Beach at Havelock Island, Taj Exotica Resort & Spa, Andamans is a luxurious gateway to a globally significant biodiversity hotspot in the Bay of Bengal. There are 54 modern luxury Villas on stilts under a canopy of Coconut and Palmyra trees; a contemporary haven built without cutting off a single tree.
