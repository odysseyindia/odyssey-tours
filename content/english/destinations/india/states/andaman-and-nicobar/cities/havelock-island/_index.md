Radhanagar Beach (Beach #7) was rated as the best beach in Asia by Time Magazine in 2004, and is still exceptionally beautiful today, with gorgeous, silky white sand backed by a forest that provides welcome shade, overlooking deep turquoise waters. Some stretches are good for swimming, and one can also find some with excellent coral reefs for perfect snorkeling experiences.
