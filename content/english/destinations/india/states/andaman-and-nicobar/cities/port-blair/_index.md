Port Blair, the capital of the Andaman & Nicobar Islands, lies on the east coast of South Andaman Island and is the main entry point to the islands. Ferry boats link Port Blair to outlying islands. These islands are ringed with fine white coral sand, and one only has to wade in knee-deep to enter an underwater world filled with a dazzling variety of fish and corals.
