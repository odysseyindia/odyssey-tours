  - Early morning cycle tour of Jaipur
---
In the early morning, you join a small group of like-minded travellers for a unique journey by bicycle into the streets of the old city. You experience the true Jaipur, as you cycle through the narrow alleys to get a peek into homes, kitchens and workshops. You learn about the lives of the locals and the history of the city, and visit the colourful and bustling vegetable and flower markets. You also enjoy a traditional Rajasthani breakfast in a local house.
