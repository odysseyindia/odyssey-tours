The picturesque town of Itanagar, Arunachal Pradeshâ€™s capital, is located in the southern foothills of the Himalayas. It is home to a large number of Nyishi tribes who speak a language of Sino-Tibetian origin. Itanagar takes its name from the 14th- to 15th-century irregular shaped Ita Fort, said to have been constructed using 8 million bricks. Now, only the ruins remain, standing amidst sprawling gardens and offering splendid views of the city.
