One of the prettiest landscapes in India, the fertile Ziro Valley is nestled among Arunachal's formidable mountains. The valley is home to the Apatani people who are famous for their paddy farms which double up as fish cultivations, with farmers using traditional irrigation techniques to rear fish in knee-deep water. The bamboo forests and pine groves surrounding the paddy fields only add to the charm of the valley as do the Apatani tribal women who wear distinctive nose-plugs, facial tattoos and wooden jewelry.
