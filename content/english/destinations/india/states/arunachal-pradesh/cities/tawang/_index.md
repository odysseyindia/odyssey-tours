Tawang is situated in the northwestern corner of Arunachal, close to the borders of Tibet and Bhutan. The town occupies a hill at 3,048 m against a backdrop of snow-clad mountains. The main attraction is the 17th century Tawang Monastery, said to be the biggest Buddhist monastery in India. In 1959, when the present Dalai Lama fled from Tibet, he crossed over into India and spent a few days in this monastery, before reaching Assam.
