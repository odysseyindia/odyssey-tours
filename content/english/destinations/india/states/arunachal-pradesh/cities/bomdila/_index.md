About one-third of the journey time from Tezpur to Tawang, Bomdila is a pleasant small town winding up a hillside, with a large Buddhist monastery at the top. The gompa comprises the main prayer hall, a temple dedicated to the Buddha and residential quarters for the monks, and features a large and colourful prayer wheel. The hilltop monastery offers panoramic views of the town of Bomdila.
