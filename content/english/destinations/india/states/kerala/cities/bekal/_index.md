In Kerala's far north, Bekal is a lovely stretch of beaches, palm groves, red earth and paddy fields. It is also known for the enormous 17th century Bekal Fort. Tipu Sultan made it a base but eventually lost it to the British. This huge circular sea fort houses the Magazine, an Observation Tower and peepholes. There is also an ancient Anjaneya Temple, a mosque, a sea bastion and several underground passages.
