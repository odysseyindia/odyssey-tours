A beautiful, spacious resort done in the Balinese style (but with lovely roofs inspired by Kerala's houseboats), the Vivanta by Taj is a great luxury option in this corner of Kerala. The extensive grounds offer lots of sitouts and hidden courtyards and gardens, a choice of restaurants, a large swimming pool and a spa and plunge pools, in between the tropical-themed rooms and cottages. Plenty of activities are offered, but relaxation is your best bet here.
