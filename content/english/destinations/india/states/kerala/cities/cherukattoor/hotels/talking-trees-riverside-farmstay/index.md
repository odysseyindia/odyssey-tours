Talking Trees is a riverside farmstay that strives to conserve and nurture the biodiversity of Kerala's plantation belt. The farmstay offers four airy and inviting rooms, each with a double king-size bed and plenty of bird-life around. The hosts stay on site, and offer you the warmth of a home. They plant trees, and grow their own vegetables and fruits, besides housing a modest number of farm animals. A great option with kids.
