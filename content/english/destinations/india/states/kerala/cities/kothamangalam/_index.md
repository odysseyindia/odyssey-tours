Kothamangalam is the perfect base from which to visit Thattekkad Bird Sanctuary. This sanctuary was discovered by the renowned ornithologist of India, Dr. Salim Ali and is named after him. The sanctuary, nestled in evergreen forests, is noted for indigenous birds like the Malabar grey hornbill. Rare birds like the Ceylon frogmouth and rose-billed roller are also seen here.
