Mundackal is a grand bungalow built from exposed granite stone and with a red tiled roof. It has marble floors and five spacious simply furnished guestrooms.    Adjoining the house is a flower filled garden which leads a large farm of active rubber and cardamom plantations.     The owners, Jose and Daisy, are wonderful hosts, and their homestay is a perfect base for visiting the nearby Salim Ali Bird Sanctuary.
