Kochi (or Cochin) is set on a cluster of islands and narrow peninsulas and has one of the best natural harbours in the world. The famed ‘Malabar Spices’ were exported from this very port, bringing to Kochi visitors as varied as the Arabs, the Dutch, the Portuguese and, finally, the British. All of them have left their mark on the architecture, making Kochi one of the most unique and fascinating towns in India.
