An excellent hotel situated at the historic site of a 19th-century boatyard. All rooms have a magnificent view of the busy shipping channel. The hotel has its own private jetty, which doubles up as a cafe overlooking the pool,  the garden and the sea. The hotel is right next to the Chinese fishing nets and close to the sights of Fort Cochin.
