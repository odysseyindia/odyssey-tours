A handsome red coloured building, the Koder House belonged to a venerable Jewish family for two centuries.     The family members have traditionally been the wardens of the Synagogue and the Koder family enjoyed an almost royal status in Cochin society. As a result Koder House has entertained many dignitaries from various parts of the world. It has now been lovingly restored and turned into a very special hertitage hotel.
