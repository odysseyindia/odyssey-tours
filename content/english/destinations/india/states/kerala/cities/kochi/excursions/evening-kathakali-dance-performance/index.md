  - Evening Kathakali dance performance
---
We provide entry tickets to an evening performance of kathakali and other dances from Kerala. In kathakali, the actors depict characters from the Puranas and the Mahabharata - superhuman beings, demons, and ordinary men and women. The dancers, all males, adorn themselves in huge skirts and headdress, wearing what must surely be the most intricate make-up of any dance style in the world. As this tour does not require a guide, we only provide the entry tickets. The venue is either within walking distance or a short rickshaw ride away from your hotel.
