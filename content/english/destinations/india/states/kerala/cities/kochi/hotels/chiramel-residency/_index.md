The Chiramel Residency is located in the heart of Fort Cochin, just across from the historic St. Francis Church where Vasco da Gama is buried.     This ancient Dutch house has been converted into a small guest house with simple rooms but lots of atmosphere.     Your personal hosts are Sunny Mathew and Asha Abraham, the owners, who occupy the lower half of this rambling mansion.
