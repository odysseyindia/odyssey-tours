Over three centuries the Malabar House Residency in Fort Cochin served as a residence for wealthy traders and influential bankers. Now the new German owner has converted this heritage building into a small boutique hotel with 12 rooms, all furnished with select antique furniture and artifacts. Situated near the famous St. Francis Portuguese Church, it is now one of the most stylish boutique hotels in Cochin.
