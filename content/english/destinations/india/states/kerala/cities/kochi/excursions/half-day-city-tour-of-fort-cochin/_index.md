At the entrance of Kochi harbour, the Chinese fishing nets are fascinating. A short walk away is St Francis Church, built by the Portuguese in 1510. Vasco da Gama, who died in 1524, was buried here. Also in Fort Kochi is a 17th-century Jewish synagogue. Scrolls of the Old Testament and copper plates inscribed in Hebrew are preserved here. There is also the 'Dutch' Palace, built by the Portuguese for the Raja of Cochin in 1555.
