This relaxing and serene home stay is run by Mr. Walton and his family. Their centuries old Dutch building is centrally located on Princes Street in the centre of Fort Cochin.    The building has a pleasant garden courtyard where you find 6 double rooms and a garden cottage, all with an attached bathroom.    You can experience the high standards of friendly cheerful service at the communal family breakfast table.
