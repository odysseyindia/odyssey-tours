A 350-year-old building built by the Dutch East India Company, this was once called the Crystal or Glass Palace, and was later used by the British for the navy. Now a charming heritage hotel, it has lovely rooms with wooden floors and ceilings, modern bathrooms, a central courtyard with poolside dining, and a timeless air.
