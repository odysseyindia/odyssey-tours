Anchor House is a small waterfront hotel near the old Bazaar Street in Mattancherry. Here, guests gravitate to the waterfront terrace, on both levels, where meals are served. One can spend hours sitting here, watching the boats in the harbour.    The waterfront has a constant bustle of various commuter ferries, large carriers and occasionally, the majestic Queen Mary! The centuries old trade continues in old warehouses belonging to grain and provision suppliers.
