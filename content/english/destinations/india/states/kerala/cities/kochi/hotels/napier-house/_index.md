In a quiet narrow street of Fort Kochi is Napier House, a small home-stay. This simple building dates back to the Dutch era with a few comfortable modern additions.     The suite is done in the original Dutch style. There are hardwood floors, an elegant four poster canopied bed and a sunny private balcony. The other rooms are a mixture of original and modern.    All guests have access to a lounge on the first floor and a terrace with dining tables.
