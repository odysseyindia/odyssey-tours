Relax into the slow rhythm of local life along the shore while gliding through languid palm-fringed canals and lagoons where longboats laden with coir and cashew drift past and fishermen call from paddle boats to sell their catch. Take forays onto shore for a chance to walk through rarely visited villages, discover hidden temples and magical shrines. Spy egrets wading in the shallows as iridescent kingfishers swoop overhead and turtles raise their heads from the watery depths.
