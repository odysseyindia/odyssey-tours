Neeleshwar Hermitage was the first luxury resort to open in the unspoiled, crowd-free coast of northern Kerala. It has a superb natural location, on an empty beach of soft white sand, flanked by a freshwater lagoon and surrounded by coconut and mango groves. Eagles, kingfishers and herons glide above the thatched cottages that house spacious, luxurious bedrooms, built using sustainable wood.
