Set amidst a coconut grove on the banks of the Periyar River, the Hornbill Camp consists of simple cottage tents built on raised platforms. The camp overlooks the lowland forests of the Salim Ali Bird Sanctuary. There is no better place to go birding, kayaking on the Periyar river or cycling through the spice-growing villages of Kerala. A variety of activities are offered, from nature walks to archery.
