Kottayam is a busy market town on Vembanad Lake. The economic strength of the large Christian community, most of them owners of sprawling plantations, makes Kottayam one of the most prosperous towns in Kerala. Kottayam is an ideal take off point for trips into the panoramic backwaters at nearby Vembanad Lake and the backwaters of Kumarakom.
