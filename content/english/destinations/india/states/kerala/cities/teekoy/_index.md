The village of Teekoy, near the origin of the Meenachil River at Vagamon, is a hill station on the Idukki-Kottayam border. It offers a plantation homestay at Vanilla County. With rolling knolls cloaked in emerald green, evergreen tea gardens, the exquisite, mist-embracing trees, cascading waterfalls and hilltops, the area around Teekoy is a place of astonishing natural beauty.
