Serenity at Kanam Estate is situated at Vazhoor, a two-hour drive from Cochin and halfway to the wildlife reserve of Periyar, near Thekkady, making it an ideal stopover. Sitting on a small hilltop, the views over the Blue Mountains of the Western Ghats are breathtaking, and the surrounding rubber plantation, along with the shady pool, papaya trees and pepper vines, create a thoroughly tropical feel.
