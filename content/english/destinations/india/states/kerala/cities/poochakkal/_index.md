Poochakkal is part of a small island close to the Kerala backwaters. The area offers scenic village lanes for walks, quiet nooks for the avid reader and calm stretches of water to tempt you to take up oars. Bird watching is a favourite pastime, as are fishing and canoeing. You may be most tempted, though, to simply relax under a palm tree by the lagoons.
