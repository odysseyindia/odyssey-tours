Tucked away in the Wayanad district of Kerala is the quaint little hill station of Vythiri. This is an area with acres of verdant vegetation, gurgling streams, mist-covered mountains and colourful birds. Fast-flowing rivers cut across the undulating panorama and lend a picture-postcard look. Luxuriant plantations of coffee, tea, cardamom, pepper and rubber, going as far as the eye can see, are a sheer delight.
