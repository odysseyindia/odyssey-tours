Set by a river near lovely Mararikulam Beach, Heritage Marari was built from old Kerala homes - the cottages reflect this, with glowing wood and old-world charm. Although a small resort, it is run more like a homestay, and is known for excellent coastal Kerala food.    A great place to relax, it offers simple activities like canoe rides, bicycle trips through the village, fishing (and cooking it yourself!), as well as yoga and ayurvedic massage.
