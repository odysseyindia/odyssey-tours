Abad Turtle Beach is a very pleasant resort set on 13 acres of land. It has the beautiful white sands of Marari Beach on one side and the rivulet on the other side. The cottages are modern, spacious and well equipped, with outdoor sitting areas and hammocks. There is a swimming pool, a vegetable garden, cycles for hire, an ayurvedic centre, and a restaurant with good-value food. There is direct access onto the beach, which is cleaned and patrolled by the resort's own lifeguards. The overall feel is one of space, peace, and relaxation.
