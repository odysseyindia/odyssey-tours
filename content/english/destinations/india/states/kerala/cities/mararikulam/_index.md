Situated 56km south of Kochi and just a few kilometres north of Allapuzha, Mararikulam offers one of the most fabulous stretches of soft sandy beach, fringed with swaying palms. In the village, life still goes on much as it did a hundred years ago, with the men going out to sea each day to earn a living bringing in the daily catch. It is an idyllic retreat for those who want to "get away from it all".
