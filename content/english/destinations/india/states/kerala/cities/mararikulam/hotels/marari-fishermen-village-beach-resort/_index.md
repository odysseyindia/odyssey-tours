A pleasant seaside resort with a row of individual small bungalows, Fisherman Village Beach resort is situated between the port city of Cochin and Alleppey.    Fresh white sand starts right outside the rooms and a row of palms lead you to the ultra clear waters. A young garden, planted among the older palm trees, makes for a pleasant ambience.
