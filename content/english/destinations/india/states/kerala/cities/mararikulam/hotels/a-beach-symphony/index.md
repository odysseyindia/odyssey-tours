A fabulous, stylish small beach resort with just 5 cottages, far enough from each other to feel totally secluded. Each cottage is a delight: some have incorporated old wooden houses whilst others are totally new, but with such a glorious eye to detail that you will want to linger at each one of them.There are smooth cement floors in earth tones, colourful silk cushions, bric-a-brac on the walls and amazing bathrooms.
