Mararikulam isn't a tourist beach but rather a peaceful place to relax and unwind. The village is spread along both sides of a narrow road. You pass lush coconut and banana plantations hiding small traditional houses. Cycles are still used commonly as a mode of transport as are dug-out canoes punted on narrow canals.     Mararikulam's few accommodation choices are well separated and all located in typical Kerala countryside. Surrounded by simple village life and with the impossibly white sandy beach, Mararikulam is a unique opportunity to escape the world.
