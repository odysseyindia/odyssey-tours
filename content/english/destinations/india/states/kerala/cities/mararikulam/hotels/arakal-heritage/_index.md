Tucked away behind village houses and thick groves, is the ancient home of the Arakal family.     The old home, a mini-tharavad, sits sungly under thick tree cover and is separated from the beach by a lick of tidal water and sand.     The small cottages are all under shady trees, hung with hammocks. Each cottage has its own sit-out enclosed by carved Kerala railing in wood. The beach is a mere minute's walk away!
