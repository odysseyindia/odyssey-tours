The Beach at Pollethai is an exclusive, beautiful resort. Cottages tucked away under trees, offer privacy and peace, with the beach and blue sea on one side and meandering streams and water bodies on the other.    The beaches at Mararikulam and adjoining Pollethai thankfully remain pristine and quiet. The only sounds you will hear will be the waves, the rustling of the palms and the boats being pulled in by fishermen.
