Citus Retreats is beautifully located along the backwaters near Alleppey. There is no  road access so a ferry is arranged by the resort to take you along the river to the hotel reception.    The resort offers spacious and airconditioned  rooms, decorated with rich-colored fabrics and dark wood furnishings. There is a swimming pool and a restaurant which serves a selection of South Indian dishes and Mediterranean flavors. A second food outlet offers dishes prepared with fresh organic ingredients.
