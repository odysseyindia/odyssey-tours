Taamara (the lotus) is a premium homestay beautifully located on the backwaters just north of  Allapuzha.  The home has two chic cottages that share a wonderful deck overlooking the Vembanad Lake. An ideal place to read and relax.    Taamara is the 100 year old home of Mr. V. V. Babu, an award-winning filmmaker and his gracious wife, Nirmala. They are perfect hosts who will treat you to some authentic Kerala cuisine.
