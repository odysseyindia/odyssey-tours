Alleppey (also called Allapuzha) is a bustling town south of Kochi, and a major trading centre for the coir industry. It is also the centre of Kerala's backwaters, with many interesting homestays in nearby villages. Caressed by the Arabian Sea and with a vast network of lakes, lagoons and rivers, this region shelters some unique animal and birdlife.
