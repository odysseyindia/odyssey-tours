A treasure-trove close to the beach, this colonial bungalow once hosted Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru, and has been lovingly restored. The large house has just 4 rooms accessed from sunny corridors, a well-sized and quiet pool, and a grand lounge. Verandahs run almost the length of the house, and there are lovely, lazy nooks everywhere, and a restaurant with views of the sea and the lighthouse.
