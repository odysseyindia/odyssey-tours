Nelpura Heritage Homestay is a renovated structure adjoining the ancestral house of Mr Chacko's family, situated on a narrow backwater canal under palm trees. This welcoming homestay offers three simple rooms in the traditional Kerala style, with plenty of seasoned timber. Eat excellent food with the family at their table, and enjoy canoe rides, cycling, village walks, visits to local schools and markets, and cooking classes.
