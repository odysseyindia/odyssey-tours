Another small gem from the Malabar House family of Kochi, Privacy sits on the banks of the vast Vembanad Lake.     There are only two waterfront bungalows - one with just one air-conditioned suite and the other with two bedrooms. There is a lakeside swimming pool so that you can enjoy the views even while swimming.    Like with other Malabar House properties, this place too is furnished to a high level of comfort, with an emphasis on personal service.
