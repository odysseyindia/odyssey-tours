Sitting on the edge of a peninsula, surrounded by three sides of the pristine Vembanad lake, Vismaya is a boutique 2-room hideaway, a 400-year-old royal house that has been completely restored and renovated by a Swiss architect. This is an airy refuge, meant for tranquil relaxation with great meals and breathtaking lake views all around.
