A charming small backwater resort on Vembanad Lake. The resort consists of 12 independent ethnic Tharavads (ancient Kerala houses) with unique open-to-sky bathrooms. These Tharavads have been painstakingly re-assembled from the original, using only wood, bricks and tiles. There is a lovely free-form swimming pool and an Ayurveda centre.
