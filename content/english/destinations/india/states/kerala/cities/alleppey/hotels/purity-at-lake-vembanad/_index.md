A serene, romantic waterfront retreat on palm-fringed Lake Vembanad, Purity's rooms all offer terraces or balconies overlooking the lake. The art gallery-like hotel showcases plenty of antiques and modern art, and the idyllic lakeside garden houses a waterfront pavilion for arrival and departure by boat, a stunning pool, as well as an ayurvedic spa and yoga space.
