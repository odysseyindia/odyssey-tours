Stay at this 100 year old mansion along one of the backwater canals in Allapuzha and enjoy the Kerala cuisine.    A stroll round the house feels like a tour of a lived-in museum; there's an abundance of curios and everything is properly ordered.     Furniture is made of teak and rosewood. The living room boasts of a collection of antiques in brass and wood.
