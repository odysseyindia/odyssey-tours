The small village of Lakkidi, 5km south of Vythiri, occupies one of the highest locations in Wayanad and it therefore also commands the most picturesque scenery. The lofty mountain peaks, the gurgling streams, luxuriant vegetation and the bird's-eye view of the deep valley to the south, are breathtaking.
