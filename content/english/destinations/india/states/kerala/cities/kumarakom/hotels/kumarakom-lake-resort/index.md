A new superior resort on the banks of Vembanad Lake. The hotel consists of 52 air-conditioned cottages set in 10 acres of greenery. The cottages have the old-world charm as they are restored traditional Kerala homes. Offering you a private courtyard, an open-air sunken bath at the back and grey-green canals slicing the front yard.
