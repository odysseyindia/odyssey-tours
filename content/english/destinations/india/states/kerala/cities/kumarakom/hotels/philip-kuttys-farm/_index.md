An unpretentious homestay on a small island farm in the Kerala backwaters, Philip Kuttys Farm has lovely cottages with lakeside views.    You get a real feel for Keralan life here thanks to the Mathew family. All meals are included in the price and these feasts are invariably the high point of the day. Breakfast may be had in the privacy of your own cottage verandah.
