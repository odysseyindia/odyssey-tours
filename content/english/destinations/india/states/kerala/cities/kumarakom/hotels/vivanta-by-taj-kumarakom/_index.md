Set in rustic surroundings, the 120-year old Baker's Bungalow once belonged to a family of Christian missionaries and rubber planters. Completely refurbished whilst retaining the colonial character, it now forms the nucleus of the luxury Taj Garden Retreat. There are 22 air-conditioned and elegantly appointed rooms in cottages and in the main Baker's Bungalow.
