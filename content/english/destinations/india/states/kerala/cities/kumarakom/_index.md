Surrounded by a vast network of rivers and canals which empty out into Vembanad Lake, the small village of Kumarakom is now the home of a number of excellent backwater resorts. The Kumarakom Bird Sanctuary, located on the banks of Vembanad Lake, is an ornithologist's paradise and a favourite haunt of migratory birds. A cruise on the lake is the best way to experience the sanctuary.
