Situated  915m above sea level, Peermade is situated close to Periyar wildlife sanctuary. Wide vistas of tea, cardamom, rubber and coffee plantations interspersed with silver cascades, sculptural rocks, meadows and mist-cloaked hilltops make Peermede an unforgettable experience. The most delightful trekking trails in Kalthotti, Karandakapara hills and Peeru hills complement the panoramic landscape.
