Near the town of Muvattupuzha is Haritha Farm, meant to be a role model for economically-viable eco farming. Established in 1962 as a rubber and coconut garden, the owners moved into sustainable farming in 1990, then got rid of non-eco-friendly rubber, and now grow coconut, pineapple, banana, yam, tapioca, spices, tropical fruits trees and medicinal herbs. The farm also has a small number of cows and free-range chickens.
