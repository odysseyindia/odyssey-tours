One of India's most beautiful landscapes, the Kerala backwaters are a vast network of canals, rivers, lagoons and lakes. Thrikunnapuzha is a small island along the backwaters with an interesting coir-making village. A visit will familiarise you with the traditional and eco-friendly coir industry. You can explore the area by dug-out canoe or on foot.
