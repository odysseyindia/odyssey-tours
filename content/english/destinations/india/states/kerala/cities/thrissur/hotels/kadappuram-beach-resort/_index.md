An ethnic style beach resort situated at the peaceful Nattika beach near Trissur town. The coconut palm thatched cottages (non-airconditioned)  have ceilings panelled with aromatic herbal grasses. The excellent beach nearby is accessed by means of a rustic bamboo bridge, across a large pool of tidal sea water.
