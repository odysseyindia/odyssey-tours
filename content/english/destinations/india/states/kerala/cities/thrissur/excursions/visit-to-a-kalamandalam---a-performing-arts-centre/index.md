  - Visit to a Kalamandalam - a performing arts centre
---
You will make a morning visit to a Kalamandalam - a performing arts training centre - which prides itself on maintaining and teaching the great arts of Keralan society. Here, students stay at the school to learn (over many years) the various performing arts of Kerala, from playing classical musical instruments to comic dances to making their own kathakali masks.  Note: The Kerala Kalamandalam is functional on all weekdays except Saturdays and Sundays, Regional holidays, National holidays, Public holidays, Strikes or Hartals. The Kerala Kalamandalam will also be closed for examinations and summer holidays from the end of March and the tour will not be available during the vacation period. Bookings will reopen from the month of June. The school will also be closed for 10 days during Onam holidays and 10 days in December for the Christmas holidays.
