A 3 km long road winds through beautiful tea estates to the camp at Nature Zone. The views that greet you are truly awe-inspiring, overlooking Munnar, valleys, lakes and high mountain ranges beyond.    Around a dozen tents are pitched on the slopes, all enjoying these stupendous views. In addition, there are a few tree houses, each with a balcony hanging in the tree canopy from where you can enjoy the views.
