Sprawling tea plantations, picture-book towns with old Raj-style bungalows, winding lanes and cool air make Munnar the perfect place for a relaxed holiday. Munnar also has the highest peak in South India, Anaimudi. Here you also find the Eravikulam/Rajamalai National Park, the last stronghold of the world's rarest mountain goat, the Nilgiri tahr.
