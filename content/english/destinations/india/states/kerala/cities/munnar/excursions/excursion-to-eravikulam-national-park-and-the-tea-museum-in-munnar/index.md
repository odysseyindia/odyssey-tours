---
To get up close to some of the world's last Nilgiri tahr (a variety of mountain goat or ibex), visit nearby Eravikulam National Park. Existing only in the mountain grasslands of the Western Ghats at altitudes above 2,000m (6,400 ft), the tahr is as endangered as the tiger. You walk along an often-foggy road lined, with easy sightings: the tahrs have grown so used to visitors that you can get within a few yards of them. Please note that the park is usually closed in February and March as this the calving season. Exact dates for closure are usually released though at the last moment.    Tata Tea recently opened a Tea Museum at the Nallathanni Estate of Tata Tea in Munnar which houses curios, photographs and machinery, each depicting a turning point that contributed to a flourishing tea industry, as seen today in the region. The museum is closed on Mondays.
