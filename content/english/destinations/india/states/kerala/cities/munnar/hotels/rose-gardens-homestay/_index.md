Rose Garden is a working plants nursery and is a passion of its owner, Mr Joseph Tomy and his wife, Rajee. There are only two guest rooms in Rose Garden - simple but adequate, with attached bathroom.     Living at Rose Garden is being immersed in the world of flowers and plants. The verandah outside is draped with an orange flowering vine. The nursery area is all around the house and nature treks are possible nearby.
