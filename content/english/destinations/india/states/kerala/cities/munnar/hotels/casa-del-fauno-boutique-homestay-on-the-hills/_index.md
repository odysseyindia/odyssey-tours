This is a small stylish homestay with excellent views of the Kanan Devan hills, famous for their tea production.     The three guest rooms are in cottages - pleasingly low buildings in colonial style with a lovely verandah with a roof supported by bamboos. The views are fabulous from here. Inside, the rooms have high ceilings with wooden rafters. The rooms are spacious and open out onto the verandah and the views beyond.
