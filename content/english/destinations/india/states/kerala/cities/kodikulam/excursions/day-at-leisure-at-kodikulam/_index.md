A large number of activities are available at Dewalokam, which you can book on the spot. These range from a spice walk to bamboo rafting, cycling to nearby villages, going for a swim in the nearby river or in a rock pool, or visiting a school in the village. You can also learn to cook traditional Syrian Christian food, or try your hand around the organic farm.
