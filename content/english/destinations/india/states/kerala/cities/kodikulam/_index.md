Kodikulam is a village in the plantation-dotted district of Idukki in Kerala, with a number of Hindu temples and a thriving Syrian Christian community. As this is also the 'spice garden of Kerala', expect to see lots of pepper, cardamom, vanilla and nutmeg, both around houses and in your food. You'll also enjoy the great biodiversity in the region, especially the bird life.
