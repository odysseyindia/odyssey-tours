Dewalokam, which means 'paradise', is the ancestral farm of the Alilakuzhy family. The large, roomy house is on an organic farm, which features unusual trees and plants, many of medicinal value. There are eight comfortable rooms, with traditional decor, overlooking the river and the forest beyond. Meals with the family are highlights, with traditional Kerala dishes, including the elaborate 'sadya', served on a banana leaf.    Activities at Dewalokam    A large number of activities are available at Dewalokam, which you can book on the spot. These range from a spice walk to bamboo rafting, cycling to nearby villages, going for a swim in the nearby river or in a rock pool, or visiting a school in the village. You can also learn to cook traditional Syrian Christian food, or try your hand around the organic farm.
