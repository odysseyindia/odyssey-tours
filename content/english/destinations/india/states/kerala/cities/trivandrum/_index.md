Trivandrum (also known as Thiruvananthapuram) is the capital of Kerala, which retains a rural air away from the crowded centre. The most interesting part of town is the Fort area, encompassing the Shri Padmanabhaswamy temple and Puttam Malika palace. The artistic and cultural heart, exemplified by the Shri Chitra Art Gallery and Napier Museum, is to the north, and the beach resort of Kovalam is just half an hour away.
