Kalaketty Estate is a traditional Syrian Christian home, built in the 1930s by the current owner's grandfather. Nestled inside a lush 150-acre plantation that grows rubber, cocoa and spices, the estate home has heavily timbered doors and windows, and the red-oxide polished floors are set off by the white walls, made of stucco mixed with egg whites, giving you a very tropical experience.     When you stay here, you will enjoy traditional Keralan meals, a good chance to explore the plantation and villages nearby, and plenty of time to relax under beautiful old mahogany and teak trees.         Activities at Kalaketty Estate      There are a number of activities you can choose from when you stay at Kalaketty Estate, like walking or taking a jeep ride through the plantation, going down to the brooks and streams, watching how rubber is made, cycling through the nearby villages, or visiting a nearby ashram. This is also a great birding spot, so wake up early and head out with your binoculars!
