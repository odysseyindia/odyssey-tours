Kalaketty is a village in the midland region of Kerala, best known for its rubber plantations. Kalaketty lies on the Sabarimala pilgrimage route, and lots of Shiva devotees pass through during the Makaravilakku festival period in winter, to visit the local temple. With rolling knolls cloaked in emerald green, evergreen tea gardens, exquisite trees, waterfalls and misty hilltops, this is an area of astonishing natural beauty.
