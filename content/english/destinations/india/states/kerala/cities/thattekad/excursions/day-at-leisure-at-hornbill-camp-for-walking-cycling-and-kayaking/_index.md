Your stay at The Hornbill Camp includes complimentary activities, including a plantation walk, a cycling trip and a kayaking adventure. The quiet and lush countryside is ideal for walkers to discover Kerala through its trails and villages. You can explore a rubber estate, a spice plantation and numerous farms, and a magnificent dam. You can also kayak to some of the spice-growing villages upstream. Check on arrival with the camp manager when you could do these activities.
