Windermere Riverhouse organises a number of activities to help you explore the region, from birding trails to cycle rides, and a forest walk to the scenic Bhootathankettu Dam to meet the Bhoota tribals. You can visit the farming community of Neriamangalam, take a canoe ride on the river, do a spot of yoga on your own (or ask for a yoga instructor in advance). You can also just relax in this languid setting - take a book and be at ease by the river!
