The port city of Kollam (or Quilon), a centre of the cashew industry, lies on the banks of picturesque Ashtamudi Lake. It is the southern part of the unique backwaters of Kerala, a network of lakes, canals, and estuaries opening into the sea, and rich with aquatic life. The canals connect the villages and are still used for local transport. Traces of a once-prosperous trade with China are still seen in the form of Chinese fishing nets, huge Chinese water pots, blue and white porcelain and sampan-like boats.
