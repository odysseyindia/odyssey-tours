An idyllic resort on the banks of Ashtamudi Lake. There are 20 spacious air-conditioned rooms in five chalets and from every room you have a beautiful view over the garden and the Chinese fishing nets. The emphasis of this resort is on Ayurveda treatment and there is a fully staffed centre, built in traditional Kerala style, next to the resort.
