Kovalam is Kerala's most famous beach resort. It is an excellent place to soak in the sun and enjoy the sea and rejuvenate oneself with Ayurvedic massages and treatments. Even though popular, the beaches are still fairly quiet by European standards. The bare rocks and the sandy beaches create some stunning settings at sunrise and sunsets.
