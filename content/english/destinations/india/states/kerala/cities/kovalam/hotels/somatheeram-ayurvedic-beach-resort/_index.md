A delightful beach resort well known for its excellent Aurvedic and Yoga centre. Situated on a 15 acre hillside spilling down to a superb stretch of beach, there are various styles of reconstructed, traditional Kerala cottages and houses, each with a private sit-out. The rooms are charming but simple with ceiling fans and attached bathroom.
