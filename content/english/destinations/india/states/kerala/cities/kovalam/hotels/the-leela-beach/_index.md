Charles Correa's award winning hilltop hotel. The lobby and public areas, including the swimming pool, are at the top whilst the rooms drop down the hillside to the beach, each room with its own large balcony. Bars, restaurant, pools, yoga centre and tennis courts should make this one of Kovalam swankier options but the management is often indifferent.
