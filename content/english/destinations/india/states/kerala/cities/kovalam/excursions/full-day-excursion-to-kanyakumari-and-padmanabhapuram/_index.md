Kanyakumari is India's `land's end', the southernmost tip of the mainland, at the confluence of the Indian Ocean, Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal. Kanyakumari is the only place in India where one can watch the sun set and moon rise simultaneously on a full moon evening. The Vivekananda Rock Memorial stands on an offshore rock, in memory of the philosopher Swami Vivekananda, who would come and contemplate here.    

The beautiful 16th-century Padmanabhapuram Palace, just over the state border with Tamil Nadu, was the capital of the Travancore rulers for more than 400 years. It is built entirely of wood, with immaculate teak floors and beautifully-carved rosewood ceilings. Please note: the palace is closed on Mondays.
