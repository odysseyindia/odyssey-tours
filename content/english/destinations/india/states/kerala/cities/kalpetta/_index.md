Kalpetta, a quiet market town, is the district headquarters of  Wayanad, one of the most beautiful regions of Kerala, with large tracts of virgin rainforest. Wayanad is also home to several tribes. Kalpetta provides ample amenities and excellent walking country, including around the spectacular Chembra Peak (2,100m), the highest mountain in Wayanad. Kalpetta is also a good base for visiting Muthanga Wildlife Sanctuary.
