Kannur, also known as Cannanore, has had a tumultuous history with many different religions, communities and people interacting with each other. This is reflected in the curious juxtaposition of colonial buildings and modern residences in places such as Burnassery Cantonment adjoining the beach. It is also evident in the churches, ancient mosques as well as lovely temples that dot green rice fields and coconut groves here.
