An hour's drive north of Thiruvananthapuram, Varkala is being rapidly developed as an alternative to the more well-known beach at Kovalam. The beautiful white sand beach is overlooked by sheer red cliffs, which provide stunning views. Apart from the beach the other places of interest are the 2,000-year-old Sree Janardhana Swamy temple and a nature care centre where treatment is based on diet control and natural therapy.
