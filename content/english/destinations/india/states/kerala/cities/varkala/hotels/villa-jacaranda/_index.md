Villa Jacaranda is set in a tranquil and green part of Varkala called South Cliff. It is a newly-built house, modern in design with some traditional touches.     There are four large and comfortable rooms for guests. At ground level is the garden with a lily pond and fragrant subtropical plants.     The beach is a five minute walk away - as is the ancient Hindu temple of Janardhana, which is open to non-Hindus.
