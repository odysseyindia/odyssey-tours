Meppadi is a town in the beautiful and picturesque Wayanad district of northern Kerala. The area is known for its exotic plantations of rubber, coffee, tea, cardamom and pepper. Meppadi provides excellent walking country, including the ranges around the spectacular Chembra Peak (2,100m), the highest mountain in Wayanad. It is also a good base for visiting the nearby Muthanga Wildlife Sanctuary.
