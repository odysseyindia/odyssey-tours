After The Rains is set in a 16-acre coffee plantation, with astonishing views over the hills and valleys of Wayanad. As the name suggests, it's best right after the monsoon period, with lush greenery and waterfalls, but it's a relaxing spot year-round, with plenty of walks and pleasant sitouts around the property, comfortable cottages (some with bathtubs) and very good food, mostly home-grown.
