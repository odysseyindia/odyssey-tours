Quaint little cottages on stilts, jungle log cabins and, for the more adventurous, tree houses at an altitude of more than 60 ft above the ground. The restaurant is a traditional Kerala Nallukett which is over a 100 years old; it overlooks the Kallar river lined with gurgling rivulets, wild flowers and the most exotic of wild life.
