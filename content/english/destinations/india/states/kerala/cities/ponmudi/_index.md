Ponmudi is an idyllic hill station with narrow, winding pathways and cool, green, wooded environs, 915m above sea level. Along with beautiful mountain flowers, exotic butterflies, small rivulets and a deer park, the hill station also has excellent trekking trails. Not far away is Peppara Wildlife Sanctuary. Another excursion can be made to Agasthyakoodam,  the second-highest peak in Kerala, a botanist's and birder's paradise.
