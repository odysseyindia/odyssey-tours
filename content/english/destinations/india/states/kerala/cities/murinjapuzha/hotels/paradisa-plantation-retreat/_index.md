Paradisa Plantation Retreat is a small boutique hotel, in a fantastic hillside location, an hour's drive from Thekkady. Each guest room is a transplanted old Kerala wooden house, painstakingly relocated so as to enjoy the best of the panoramic views.     Each room has a verandah for relaxing on long lazy chairs and/or day beds with comfortable cushions. Located on a small plateau enjoying the view of the mountains across the steep valley is a pool with a stunning view.
