Murinjapuzha is a village close to Thekkady and site of the Paradisa Retreat, situated on an organically-grown coffee and spice plantation and with a panoramic landscape. Paradisa Retreat comprises traditional wooden Kerala houses, placed individually for complete privacy. Great care has been taken in the construction of the Retreat, not to alter the lay of the land, thereby preserving the original landscape.
