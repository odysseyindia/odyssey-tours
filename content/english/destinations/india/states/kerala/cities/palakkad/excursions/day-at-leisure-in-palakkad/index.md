Your host, Mr Bhagwaldas, often personally accompanies guests to the surrounding small village to see local craftspeople at work. He is a much respected person in the community and can take guests to see the school, visit local family homes, visit a place which makes traditional idlis, and enjoy a freshly brewed cup of chai in the local style.    If you wish, the host can arrange for his family astrologer to come and predict your future with the help of cowrie shells. This ascetic man with slender fingers reads the shells and reveals details about your personality, some past landmarks in your life and may be able to make some startling predictions.
