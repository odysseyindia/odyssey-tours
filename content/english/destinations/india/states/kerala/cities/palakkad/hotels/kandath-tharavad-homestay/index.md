This majestic old home was one of the first to open its teak doors to guests. Your host, Mr Bhagwaldas, has a genuine desire to give his guests a true glimpse of the local life and culture. You can explore the village, visit the temple to observe the evening rituals and pooja, or walk or cycle along narrow winding roads through beautiful, unspoilt rural landscapes.
