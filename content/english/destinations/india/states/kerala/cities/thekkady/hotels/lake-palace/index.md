This has to be one of the few places in India where you stand a chance of spotting tiger and wild elephant while sipping tea on your verandah. A former summer palace of the Maharaja, this heritage hotel is situated on an island in Periyar Lake and you can only reach it by boat. It has 6 charming old-fashioned rooms, great dining and a lovely lawn.
