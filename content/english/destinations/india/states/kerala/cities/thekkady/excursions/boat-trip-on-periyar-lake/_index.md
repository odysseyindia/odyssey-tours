The Periyar Wildlife Reserve is one of the largest in India. There are plenty of elephants, sambhar, wild pig, flying squirrel and over 260 species of bird life. Periyar is centred around a vast artificial lake and the best way to explore the reserve is by boat, which allows visitors to watch animals drinking at the lakeside. The best chance of sighting animals is in the early morning or at dusk.
