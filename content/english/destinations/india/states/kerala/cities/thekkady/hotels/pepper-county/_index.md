Just outside the bustling town of Kumily, Pepper County Homestay is a suavely modern and immaculate house with a sense of rural seclusion.     Pepper County is spread across 7 acres of lush green landscape comprising spice plants and fruit trees. It is owned by Mr. Cyriac and his wife Dolly.     From the house there are spectacular views across the hills and plantations. Mr. Cyriac is happy to show guests around the plantation to point out the different types of vegetation.
