This resort was designed by the renowned architect Laurie Baker along the lines of a typical Kerala village. It is situated very close to the entrance of Periyar National Park.    Constructed in traditional style, the tiled roofed cottages feature arras and nirras. These are the wooden stores attached to traditional Kerala houses for storing rice.     There is an attractive reception center and a good quality multi-cuisine restaurant.
