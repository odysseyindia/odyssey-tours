---
Different nature trails traversing diverse habitats form the trekking routes, generally 4 to 5km in length. This nature walk offers an excellent opportunity to watch birds, butterflies and other wildlife. The trails often pass through evergreen and moist deciduous forests interspersed with marshy grasslands.     Note: The program either starts at 7 am or 2.30pm and lasts for about 2.5 hours. Children of only 13 years and above are allowed to participate in the above programs. A maximum of 6 persons can go trekking at a time along each nature trail, accompanied by the trained tribal guide.
