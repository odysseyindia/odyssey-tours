Thekkady is the place to stay when you want to visit Periyar Wildlife Reserve. The journey to Thekkady affords some beautiful views of the highest mountain range in India south of the Himalayas. Periyar Sanctuary is open all year round. The best time to visit is between October and April. During April and May, when water gets low and grass dries out, there is a greater chance of spotting the elephants near the lakeside.
