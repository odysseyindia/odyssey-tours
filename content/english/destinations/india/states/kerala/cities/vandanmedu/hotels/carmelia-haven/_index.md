Carmelia Haven is an eco-friendly plantation retreat close to Thekkady. The resort nestles amidst 55 acres of tea and cardamom plantations and has a swimming pool, tennis court and ayurvedic massage centre.      Here you can stay in a tree top wooden cabin with an attached bathroom and balcony, offering unmatched views at a height! There are also cave houses and circular honeymoon suites as well as regular thatched cottages.
