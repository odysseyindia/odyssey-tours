Vandamedu is 25km or an hour's drive from Thekkady, on the highway to Munnar. The journey affords some beautiful views of the highest mountain range in India south of the Himalayas. This small town is known to be the largest cardamom producer in the world. A stay at an eco-friendly retreat at Carmelia Haven will make an unforgettable plantation experience!
