Sultan Battery is a town in Wayanad district, famous for its jungles and rain forests, and plantations of tea, spice, coffee and cocoa. It was here that Tipu Sultan built a remote fort in the 18th century. Near Sultan Battery are the Edakkal Caves, natural rock cut-out formations. These caves have become famous world-wide for their ancient carvings and pictorial wall inscriptions of human and animal figures.
