At Pepper Trail, you can learn about traditional methods of cultivation and how coffee, tea and pepper are grown, processed and consumed. It is also possible to trek into the nearby jungle to explore prehistoric caves, watch wildlife in their natural habitat and experience a rhythm of life older than man himself.    In the heart of the estate, fed by natural springs, is an acre-wide water body where you can take a coracle ride to appreciate the local flora and fauna.  If you prefer to relax then you can pamper yourself with a relaxing Ayurveda massage in a private pavilion, deep within the coffee plantation.
