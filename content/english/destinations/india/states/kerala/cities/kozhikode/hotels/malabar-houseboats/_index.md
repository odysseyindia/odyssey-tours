The Malabar houseboats ply in the serene backwaters near Kozhikode. They are very well designed with spacious bedrooms with plenty of head space, and excellent en-suite facilities. Great attention has been paid to the selection of the furniture and linen. There is a wide central seating area from where you can enjoy the views. Your stay is on full board.
