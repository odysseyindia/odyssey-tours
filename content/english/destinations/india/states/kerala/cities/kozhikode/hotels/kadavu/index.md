A modern resort on the backwaters near Khozikhode, Kadavu consists of air-conditioned and well-appointed cottages built on an aesthetically landscaped hillock sloping down to the river.     The resort has a very large swimming pool and a remarkable amphitheatre where artists perform traditional Kerala dances.
