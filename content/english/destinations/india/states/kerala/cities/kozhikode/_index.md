The history of European involvement in India began in Calicut (or Kozhikode) with the arrival of Vasco De Gama in 1498. An important port for the trade of spices, Kozhikode is now a modern, prosperous city. There are also beautiful backwaters near Kozhikode. An important transportation network for the fishing, spice and rice industries, these backwaters are home to villagers whose lives revolve around the waters.
