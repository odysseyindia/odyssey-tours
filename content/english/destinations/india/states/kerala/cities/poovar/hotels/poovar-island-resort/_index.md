An idyllic resort. There are 22 land based cottages in 14 acres of lush, green coconut gardens and 6 unique floating cottages, reached by a short jetty. All the cottages are made of wood with thatched roofs; they are all air-conditioned and equipped with modern facilities. The resort also has a good Ayurvedic centre and swimming pool.
