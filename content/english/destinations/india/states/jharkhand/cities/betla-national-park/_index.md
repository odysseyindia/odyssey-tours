Betla is the small village at the entrance to Palamau National Park, in the west of the state of Jharkhand, a scenic 170km drive from the state capital, Ranchi. The park may lack fine accommodation amenities, but this is more than made up for by the opportunity to experience the landscape and wildlife of an area which sees very few foreign visitors. This is one of the best places in India to see wild elephants.
