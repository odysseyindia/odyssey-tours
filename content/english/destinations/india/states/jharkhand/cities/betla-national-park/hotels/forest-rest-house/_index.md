Raised on a small hillock overlooking the main entry to the Betla National Park, the Forest Rest House offers 6 comfortable and well-furnished rooms.     All rooms have balconies overlooking the National Park itself, from where sightings of wildlife are possible. There is a basic canteen which offers simple meals.
