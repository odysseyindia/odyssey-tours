This venerable establishment opposite the railway station was built by the South Esatern Railways themselves, one of a number of grand hotels full of old world charm catering to railway travelers.     Chanakya BNR Hotel has now been comprehensively renovated, and the bulk of the rooms are newly built and furnished in a modern style. But two wings of atmospheric "Heritage Rooms" have been retained.
