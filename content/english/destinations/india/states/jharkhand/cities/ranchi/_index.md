Ranchi is the capital of the state of Jharkhand. The state is wealthy in minerals, and this prosperity is evident in Ranchi, a surprisingly modern city with several high-class hotels. The city has grown around a lake, and at an altitude of 700m, enjoys clearer air and a less humid climate than many large Indian cities. It is a friendly place, which sees few foreign visitors, and the markets are a photographer's delight.
