Cherrapunji once received the heaviest rainfall in the world. The numerous waterfalls are most impressive during the steamy monsoon season, when awesome torrents of water plunge down to the Bangladesh plains. The drive from Shillong to Cherrapunji gives a spectacular view of deep gorges and the rolling hills, luxurious with tropical vegetation that boast an innumerable variety of ferns, moss and orchids.
