The challenging trek to the living root bridges is a highlight of any visit to Meghalaya. A flight of 2,000 steps goes down to the valley where trails lead through villages to the bridges formed from living trees. The best-known is the unique "double deck" bridge. You can also cool off in the river before starting back. This 4-6 hour trek is led by knowledgeable guides, who will point out various flora and fauna en route.
