Mawlynnong is 90km from Shillong. The drive affords magnificent views of dense foliage and hidden waterfalls. Elected as the cleanest village in Asia in 2005, Mawlynnong's citizens ensure that their environment is clean and their way of living sustainable. You can visit Sky View, a viewing platform built in a tree, with views over forests and the Bangladesh plains. Around 15 minutes away is a gorgeous living root bridge. About 500 years old, this bridge was formed by the twisting roots of the Indian rubber tree and is used by the village's residents for their daily commute.
