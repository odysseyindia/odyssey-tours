Shillong is the capital of Meghalaya. Recent development has been insensitive and haphazard, but the surrounding hills still retain many English-style country houses. There is a vast bustling market, Bara Bazaar, to which thousands of Khasi tribespeople flock. Overseen by sharp-eyed matriarchs, they sell everything from gold jewellery to spices and textiles. Police Bazaar resembles a Mall road as found in other hill stations.
