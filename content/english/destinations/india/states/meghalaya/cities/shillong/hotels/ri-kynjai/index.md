Ri Kynjai, a spectacular resort overlooking the picturesque Umiam Lake outside Shillong, translates from Khasi as 'land of serene environs'. The architecture is inspired by Khasi thatch huts, which make a symbolic presence as a cap on the roof of the cottages. No expense has been spared in creating this luxurious and authentic resort, making this the most desirable place to stay in the entire North East of India.
