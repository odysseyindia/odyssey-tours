  - Half day city tour of Shillong
---
The best way to enjoy Shillong's sights is on foot. With no significant monuments, the attractions here are the scenic beauty, parks, waterfalls and panoramic views. Places worth visiting include the decorative Ward Lake, and Bara Bazaar where you can see local and hill-people trading their wares including interesting jewellery and handicrafts. Beadon Falls and Bishop Falls, north of the city, are popular picnic sites.
