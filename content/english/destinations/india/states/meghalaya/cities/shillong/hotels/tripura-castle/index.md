Tucked away on a hillside lined with pine trees, bamboo groves and cherry blossoms is Tripura Castle, summer retreat of the Maharajas of Tripura. The first "heritage" hotel in the north-east, it was opened in 2003 in the Castle's Annexe. There are pine-framed rooms with period furniture and a high level of service that makes Tripura Castle one of Shillong's finest hotels.
