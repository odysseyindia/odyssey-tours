Cherrapunji, 56km south of Shillong, is one of the wettest places on Earth. Impressive waterfalls south of the town plunge down the high escarpments on the edge of the plateau. Deep wooded ravines amid the lush vegetation conceal a network of large caves. The bustling market of Cherra Bazaar is famous for honey and tribal jewellery. If you leave Shillong after breakfast, you can travel leisurely to Cherrapunji and return before sunset.
