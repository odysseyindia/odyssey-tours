A wonderful Raj-era bungalow set in spacious attractive grounds.  Built in the early 1900s and run by the Meghalaya Tourism Department, the hotel has seen better days but the ambience is still a plus point. The rooms have high ceilings and large comfortable beds. There is a  restaurant and bar and there are facilities for golf and boating.
