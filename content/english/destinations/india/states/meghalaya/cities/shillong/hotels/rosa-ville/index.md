You leave behind Shillong's chaotic traffic as the large gates open to let you into the Rosa Ville compound, where you emerge into a far more tranquil and peaceful environment, surrounded by greenery, where the atmosphere is one of gentility, with wooden floors, flowered curtains, collections of old china and brass/copper kettles, a gleaming gramophone and an old fashioned telephone.
