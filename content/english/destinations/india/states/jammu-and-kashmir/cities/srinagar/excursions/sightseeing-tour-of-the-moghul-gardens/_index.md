Shalimar Bagh is the largest and most famous Mughal Garden in Srinagar. Built by Jehangir for his wife, Nur Jahan, the gardens are distinguished by a series of terraces linked by a water channel. These are surrounded by decorative pools, which can only be reached by stepping stones. The uppermost pavillion has elegant black marble pillars and niches in the walls for flowers during the day, and candles or lamps at night.  Nishat Bagh is the second Mughal garden, as you take the road that encircles Dal Lake. Its name means Garden of Gladness. The gardens have terraces, each representing a different zodiac sign, and they offer a splendid view of the Dal Lake as well as the snow-capped Pir Panjal mountain range.
