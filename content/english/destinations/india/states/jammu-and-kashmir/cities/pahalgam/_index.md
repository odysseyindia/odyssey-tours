Pahalgam enjoys a stunning location around 100km east of Srinagar in the deep-cut Lidder Valley, whose pine-crested ridges ascend sharply from each bank of the fast-flowing river. One of the best treks you’ll find anywhere is the Kolahoi Glacier Trek, via Lidderwat. This follows the course of the Lidder River from Pahalgam up to the Kolahoi Glacier, Kashmir Valley’s largest.
