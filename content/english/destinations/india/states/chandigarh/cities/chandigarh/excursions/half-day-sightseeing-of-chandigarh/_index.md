Chandigarh is the dream city of India's first Prime Minister: planned by Le Corbusier, it has wide roads, large parks, grassy verges and well-separated residential and commercial areas, very unusual for an Indian city. A highlight is the Nek Chand Rock Garden, a collection of sculptures made by a retired civil servant. Adopted by the city, it's a cross between the Gaudi gardens, a lost city, a public park and the Crystal Maze. It is very much worth a visit, especially for kids, with waterfalls, hidden rooms, a hall of illusions and thousands of sculptures.
