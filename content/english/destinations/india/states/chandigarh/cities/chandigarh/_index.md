Designed in the 1950s by the European architect Le Corbusier and built to serve as the new capital of the states of Punjab and Haryana, this is an Indian city unlike any other. Designed on a grid, it is spacious, well-organised, clean, and renowned for its gardens, particularly the amazing Rock Garden. Trees, plants and expanses of greenery are as much part of the development plan of the city, as are buildings and roads.
