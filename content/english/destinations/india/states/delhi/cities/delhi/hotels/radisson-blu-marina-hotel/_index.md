The grand old Marina Hotel on Connaught Place has been totally refurbished by the Radisson group, thereby introducing all their usual touches such as a large, bright, spacious lobby, with well trained and helpful staff.     There are 90 rooms, and all are supremely comfortable. Though some are quite small, they all feature the abundant furnishings, fittings and amenities of a Radisson hotel.    The hotel also offers a bar, coffee shop, and a specialty kebab restaurant.
