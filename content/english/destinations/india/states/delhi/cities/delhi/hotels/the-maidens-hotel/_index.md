A brilliant white colonnaded colonial mansion in sprawling gardens and lawns close to Old Delhi. This gracious hotel offers spacious rooms, a coffee shop and a very English restaurant with Raj photographs and a good Continental menu. The pool is in a separate part of the large grounds. There is also a tennis court, and plenty of lovely seating areas and mini-lounges in which to pretend to be a colonial-era bigwig.
