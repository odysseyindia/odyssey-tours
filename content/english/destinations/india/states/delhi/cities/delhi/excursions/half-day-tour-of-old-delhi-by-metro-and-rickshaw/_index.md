A half-day tour to Old Delhi using the modern Metro and the traditional cycle rickshaw. The Metro brings you to the heart of Old Delhi in just a few minutes, to visit the magnificent Jama Masjid mosque, India's largest. You then use walk and ride cycle rickshaws through the fascinating maze of narrow streets around the main street of Old Delhi, Chandni Chowk, a bustling jumble of craft shops, traders, mosques and temples.     At one end of this street is the huge Red Fort, the symbol of Delhi, which contains within it palaces and impressive public buildings. At the other is the colourful and aromatic Spice Market, the roof of which offers great views over Old Delhi. You can also visit the bustling and colourful Sikh Gurdwara. Whilst returning to the hotel by Metro at the end of the tour, you may choose to stop off at Connaught Place to enjoy the many restaurants and more modern shops.     Note: We will not be visiting the interior of the Red Fort because on this tour we concentrate on the narrow alleys and atmosphere of Old Delhi. However, you could arrange with your local guide to see the Red Fort at the end of your half-day tour. Please also note that the Red Fort is closed on Mondays and national holidays.
