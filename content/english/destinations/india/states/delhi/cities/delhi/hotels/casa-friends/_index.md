This wonderful small boutique hotel is more like an up-market home-stay.      The nicest thing about Casa Friends, is the amount of space it offers. Apart from the generous sized rooms, there are plenty of common lounging areas.    There is a terrace with a good sized garden, a glassed in area overlooking the terrace in case it is too cool/warm outside, a chic dining area and an elegant lounge and a smaller, more intimate living area on the first floor.
