Hotel Sunstar Heritage is a mid-range hotel, located at the edge of the colourful market area of Karol Bagh. It is just a two-minute walk from the Metro station that connects you to Connaught Place - the centre of New Delhi - in just five minutes, and from where you can quickly and easily reach almost anywhere in Delhi. The rooms at this small hotel have recently been renovated and are now bright, modern, and comfortable. There is a restaurant on the top floor with an outdoor terrace.
