  - Full day city tour of Old & New Delhi
---
When the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan decided to move back from Agra to Delhi in 1638, he built within 10 years the huge city of Shah Jahanabad, now called Old Delhi, dominated by the Red Fort. The main street is Chandni Chowk, a fascinating bustling jumble of craft shops, traders, mosques and temples that leads to the magnificent Jama Masjid, well worth a visit.    New Delhi has a number of attractions, like Humayun's Tomb, a sandstone mausoleum in the authentic Mughal style - the Taj Mahal, built much later, follows a similar style of architecture. Nearby, you can see India Gate, the Parliament Buildings, the Lodhi Gardens, the Lotus Temple and the President's House, and the Sikh temple, Gurudwara Bangla Sahib. However, Delhi is huge and traffic is usually heavy, and you might not be able to see all of the attractions, so it is best to discuss with your guide which sights you might wish to visit.    Please also note that the Red Fort is closed on Mondays and national holidays.
