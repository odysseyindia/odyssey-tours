A pleasantly informal upmarket hotel in Delhi airport's Aerocity, with a modern feel, lots of art and bright, airy spaces. The rooms are large, most with views over the runways (and with excellent noise-insulation!), offering a great spot to calm yourself before or after a long-haul flight. You'll find a couple of restaurants, a great gin bar, a large swimming pool and even a spa to take the sting out of international flights.
