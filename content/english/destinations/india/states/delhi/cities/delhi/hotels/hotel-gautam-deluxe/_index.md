Gautam Deluxe is a professionally run, modern looking hotel with an unusual and attractive green lobby. The deluxe rooms are plain but comfortable, with modern fittings. The hotel also boasts of the excellent and atmospheric Pind Baluchi restaurant, which is popular with local families.     The hotel is on a busy road at the edge of the Karol Bagh market area, but the rooms are well insulated from any traffic noise.
