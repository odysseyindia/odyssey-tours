Behind every historical capital is a great big river. Starting from the little lanes of Shahjahanabad, while the city is still sleepy, we pass the formidable walls of the Red Fort, and find ourselves on the quiet banks of the Yamuna river. A boat-ride - with migratory birds above the calm waters - unravels the devotion with which the Hindus treat this river. Concluding with a memorable view of the Jama Masjid back through the streets of Old Delhi, the Yamuna Route shows the stimulating contradictions of India.
