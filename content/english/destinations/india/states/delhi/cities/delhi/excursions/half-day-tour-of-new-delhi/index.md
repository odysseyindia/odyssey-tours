  - Half day tour of New Delhi

New Delhi has a number of attractions, like Humayun's Tomb, a sandstone mausoleum in the authentic Mughal style - the Taj Mahal, built much later, follows a similar style of architecture. Nearby you can see India Gate, the Parliament Buildings, the Lodhi Gardens, the Lotus Temple, the President's House, and the Sikh temple, Gurudwara Bangla Sahib. However, Delhi is huge and traffic is usually heavy, and half a day is not enough to see all of the attractions, so it is best to discuss with your guide which sights you might wish to visit.
