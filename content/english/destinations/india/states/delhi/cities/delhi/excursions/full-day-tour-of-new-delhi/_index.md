The New Delhi tour covers most of the interesting sights in the Indian capital. The tour includes Humayun's Tomb, a sandstone mausoleum in authentic Mughal style - the Taj Mahal, built much later, follows a similar style of architecture. Nearby, you can see India Gate, the Lodhi Gardens, the Parliament Buildings, and the President's House.     


The Gandhi Memorial Museum will be of interest to those wanting to know more about India's struggle for Independence, and the Laxmi Narayan Temple is a modern Hindu temple where your guide can explain the significance of several of the Hindu gods. The Qutab Minar has a five-storey, 72-metre victory tower of red sandstone. The more modern Lotus Temple, built by followers of the Bahai faith, is also well worth visiting and is a rare, peaceful oasis in this busy city.     


Please note that the Gandhi Museum and Lotus Temple are closed on Mondays.
