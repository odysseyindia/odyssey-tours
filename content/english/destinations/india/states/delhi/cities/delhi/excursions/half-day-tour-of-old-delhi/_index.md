When the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan decided to move back from Agra to Delhi in 1638, he built within 10 years the huge city of Shah Jahanabad, now called Old Delhi, dominated by the Red Fort. The main street is Chandni Chowk, a fascinating bustling jumble of craft shops, traders, mosques and temples that leads to the magnificent Jama Masjid, well worth a visit. Please note that the Red Fort is closed on Mondays and national holidays.
