The Nizamuddin cycle tour leads you through a city of mystics, saints, poets, rebels, forgotten Kings, English ladies, refugee colonies and nameless tombs - all buried in the giddying contrast offered by upscale South Delhi. Starting in the over-700-year-old settlement of Nizamuddin, this tour, done in partnership with the Nizamuddin NGO Hope Project,  is 15km long and includes tea and breakfast in the lush Lodhi Gardens.
