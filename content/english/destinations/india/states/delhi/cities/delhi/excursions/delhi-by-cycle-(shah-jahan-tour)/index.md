  - Delhi by cycle (Shah Jahan Tour)
---
The adventurous traveller can explore Shahjahanabad, the Mughal City built by Emperor Shah Jahan (now known as Old Delhi), by bicycle. Starting in the early morning, you cycle through the narrow lanes to visit spice markets, learning about the Red Fort and Jama Masjid on the way, and enjoy morning tea and a breakfast curry at the famous Karim's restaurant.     Note: The guides keep you safe on the busy streets, but some experience of cycling in traffic is advisable, particularly when cycling through the bustling Chandni Chowk market.
