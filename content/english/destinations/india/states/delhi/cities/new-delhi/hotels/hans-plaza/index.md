An excellent moderate hotel with fabulous views. This hotel occupies the top few floors of a tall building near Connaught Place, thus offering a bird's eye view of the busy city below from its rooms and restaurant. The 70 centrally air-conditioned rooms are spacious and done in very pleasing colours and finished to a high degree of perfection.
