A delightful small hotel set around a palm filled garden. The hotel offers just 20 air-conditioned rooms, all pleasantly furnished. It has its own secluded beach, a bar and a restaurant. The attentive service and the size of the hotel makes it feel as if you are a guest at a British country-house party.
