The Hans Coco Palms is a resort in the true sense of the word: with swaying fan shaped traveller's palms catching the breeze from the nearby sea, and a dozen lounge chairs around an inviting swimming pool. Located at the quiet end of the long stretch of the Puri beach, it is close enough to the brightly-lit food stalls but far enough away for you to be able to truly enjoy its peacefulness. The large rooms are well appointed.
