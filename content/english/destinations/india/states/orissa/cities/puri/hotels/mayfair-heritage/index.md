Red-roofed cottages with greenery that climbs towards the very threshold are situated a short walk away from a private beach, a swimming pool and some very inviting lounge areas with white wickerwork chairs. The place has a very relaxed, unpretentious feel despite the fact that it is one of the top hotels in Puri.
