A boat ride takes you on one of the largest brackish-water lagoons in the world. Chilika Lake is a thriving ecosystem, and home to many threatened species of plants and animals, including the small, elusive Irrawaddy dolphins. Migratory water fowl arrive here from as far as the Caspian Sea, Lake Baika and remote parts of Siberia, Mongolia, and Iraq. You might see several thousand birds here on your visit!
