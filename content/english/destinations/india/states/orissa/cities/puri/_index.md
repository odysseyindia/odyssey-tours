Puri is a popular seaside resort, famous for the great `Car Festival' held at the Temple of Jagannath in June or July. During this festival, the image of Jagannath is placed on an enormous 15m-high wooden chariot and drawn through the streets by thousands of penitents. In times past, ecstatic pilgrims would hurl themselves under the wheels of this "juggernaut". Throughout the year, the long sandy beach is a popular attraction.
