The artists' village of Raghurajpur, close to Puri, is two streets of 120 thatched brick houses adorned with murals of geometric patterns and mythological scenes, a traditional art form that has almost died out in Orissa. The village is most famous for its patachitra work, made using cloth coated with a mixture of gum and chalk made from tamarind seeds. Artists mark out animals, flowers, deities and demons, which are then illuminated with bright colours. Traditional Odiya dances such as Gotpua can be seen on arrangement.
