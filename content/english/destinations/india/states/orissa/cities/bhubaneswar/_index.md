The capital of the state of Orissa, Bhubaneswar, is a fast expanding city offering a real contrast between the modern new buildings and hundreds of old temples. The most famous here is the Lingaraj Temple. Only Hindus can enter this temple, but there are plenty of others nearby which can be easily visited. There are also interesting caves nearby.
