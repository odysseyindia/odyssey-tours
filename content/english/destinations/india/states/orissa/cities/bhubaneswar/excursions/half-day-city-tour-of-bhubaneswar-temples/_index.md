The lively old city of Bhubaneswar is full of ancient temples. The most famous, the Lingaraj Temple, is closed to non-Hindus, but can be observed from a raised platform opposite. It is possible to visit a number of temples located around Bindu Sarovar, a tank which is believed to receive water from all the holy rivers of India. Mukteshwar, with its famous stone arch at the entrance, known as the gem of Orissan architecture, is full of sculptures on the outer walls depicting the famous folk tales of the Panchatantra.The nearby Udaygiri & Khandagiri caves feature ornate temples and shrines carved within the rocks in the 1st century BC.
