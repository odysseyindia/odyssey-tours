A good budget option in Bhubaneshwar, the Royale Midtown is a fairly conventional looking modern building on the street that is modern Bhubaneshwar's lifeline.      Green marbled corridors lined with potted plants lead to the rooms which are well sized for a city hotel and are well equipped. There is also a well serviced restaurant and a bar.
