Jeypore is endowed with waterfalls, forests and wildlife. Apart from its natural beauty, it is a convenient night halt to visit tribal villages. You can visit the colourful Bonda tribal market at Onukudelli (every Wednesday). The Bonda, the "naked people", trade at local markets, but otherwise stay isolated. The women wear beads and brass and silver, and their shaved heads are decorated with plaits of palmyra leaves.
