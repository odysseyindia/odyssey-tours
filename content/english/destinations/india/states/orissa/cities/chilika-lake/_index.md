A great shallow lagoon covering 1,100 sq km, Chilika is separated from the Bay of Bengal by a sandy ridge, with just a narrow channel connecting it to the sea. It is a beautiful, peaceful place to visit, especially from November to February, when the lake and its reed islands teem with nesting birds, including several winter migrants. These are best seen during a simple boat ride from Mangalajoli, on the northwestern shore.
