This wildlife sanctuary on the coast of Orissa shelters a large array of wildlife in its 65,000 hectares of mangrove forests. You can explore the mangroves by boat in search of crocodiles, water monitors and cobras. Bhitarkanika is the base for some intensive research studying the unique ecology of the mangroves and the Olive Ridley turtles who visit annually to lay eggs in the nearby Gahir Matha Sanctuary.
