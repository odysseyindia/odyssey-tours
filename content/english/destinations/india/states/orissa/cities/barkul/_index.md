Barkul is a convenient place to stay to visit Asia's largest saltwater lake, Chilika, noted for the migratory birds that flock here in winter. The lake is dotted with islands and is separated from the sea only by a narrow sand bar. You can take an early morning boat ride to Nalbana Island, host to sea eagles, ospreys, golden plovers, sandpipers, flamingoes, and more. The Kalijai Temple stands on one of the tiny rocky islands.
