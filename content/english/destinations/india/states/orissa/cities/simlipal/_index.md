Simlipal is Orissa's principal wildlife sanctuary. There are tigers, elephants and several types of deer, and the scenery is beautiful and varied with hills, waterfalls and undisturbed forest. Due to the inaccessibility of Simlipal, tourist facilities are not well developed, and accommodation is very simple. Since there is no restaurant, you have to bring food and a cook along from Bhubaneshwar. The park is open from November to mid-June.
