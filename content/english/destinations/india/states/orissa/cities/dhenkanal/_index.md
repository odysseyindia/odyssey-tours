Dhenkanal is a busy market town, a two-hour drive from Bhubaneswar. For 12 days every year, following the Dusshera festival, it is taken over by a large and colourful festival, during which elaborately decorated shrines to the goddess Laxmi draw huge crowds. On the final day of the festival the shrines are loaded onto trucks and a huge, noisy, colouful, parade of dancers and musicians travels slowly around the town.
