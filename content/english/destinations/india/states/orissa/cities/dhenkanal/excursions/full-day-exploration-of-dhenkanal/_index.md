In the morning, you visit fascinating handicrafts villages near Dhenkanal. At Nuapatna most homes are dedicated to sari weaving. At Saptasajya, you can see the process of turning wax into brass ornaments. You return to Dhenkanal Palace for lunch, and head out again to Joranda, for the evening puja performed by monks of the Mahima movement, who live a simple life of abstinence and meditation, a moving and unique experience.
