The southwestern part of Orissa possesses the largest concentration of tribal people in the subcontinent. When you drive southwest of Bhubaneswar to Baliguda in Phulbani district, you reach the entry point to the tribal highlands. The drive passes through beautiful countryside and forested mountains of sal trees, and a stay in this area gives travellers a chance to experience the hidden heritage of Orissa.
