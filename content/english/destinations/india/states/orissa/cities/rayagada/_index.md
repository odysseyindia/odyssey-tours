Raygada is on the way from Bhubaneswar and Puri to Jeypore. Most of Orissa's tribal people live in this southern inland part of the state, worlds away from the roads and towns of Orissa's coastal plains. They include the Munda, Kondh, Gadaba, Saora, Bonda and Koya. The Koya, who live in villages in clearings in the middle of dense forest, particularly in the deep south of Orissa, wear distinctive headgear made of bison horn.
