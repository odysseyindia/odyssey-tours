Baripada is a city in Mayurbhanj district of north Orissa, located near the famous Simlipal National Park. Baripada is a cultural centre known for ancient temples from the tenth century. Like Puri, it hosts a popular chariot festival (Rath Yatra) but here the unique custom is that only women pull the chariot of the deity and devotees from all over the country come to enjoy this festival.
