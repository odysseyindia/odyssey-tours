15km south of Bhubaneswar, on the highway to Puri, is a village of artisans famous for their colourful appliqu√©-work fabrics. The craft originated to serve temples but nowadays is used for garden umbrellas, cushion covers, wall-hangings and bags. They follow the same techniques, in which cloth is cut into birds, flowers, animals and other decorative shapes, and stitched on to fabric of a contrasting colour.
