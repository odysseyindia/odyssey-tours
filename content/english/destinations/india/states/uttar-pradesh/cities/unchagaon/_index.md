Unchagaon is a small village off the Delhi-Moradabad highway. The narrow road that leads to it is covered with lush greenery on either side. The river Ganges flows calmly near the village and is famous for its dolphin sightings. Unchagaon's claim to fame is its impressive early 18th-century fort. The place is so hidden that the fort is not easily visible unless you are standing right in front of the entrance.
