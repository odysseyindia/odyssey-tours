Fort Unchagaon was built in the early 18th century as a home for the Jat rulers who rose in prominence during the decline of the Mughal Empire.     It was originally made of mud, but the walls ware later replaced by brick, and the old building inside the fort was totally renovated during the 1930's to give it a distinctly colonial look.     The present Raja converted the property into a heritage hotel, which is still his personal residence.
