Buddhist texts claim that Kapilavastu was the childhood home of Siddhartha Gautama where he spent the first 29 years of his life as a prince. He lived a luxurious well-protected early life, got married and had a son named Rahul. According to the popular story, at one stage he saw an old man, a sick man and a dead body that made him question the meaning of life. He left everything he had in search of the meaning of life and the world got Buddha.
