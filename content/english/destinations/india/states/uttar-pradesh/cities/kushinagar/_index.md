Kushinagar is where the Buddha died and was cremated, and passed into nirvana. A modern temple, with a large "Reclining Buddha" statue, has been built to commemorate this, and various monuments relating to the Buddha's last days can be seen. In recent years, new temples have been constructed by Chinese, Sri Lankan, Thai and Japanese Buddhists alongside the ruins of ancient monasteries and stupas.
