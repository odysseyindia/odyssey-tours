A 125 year old cottage in the hills outside Nainital overlooking the lake. Built as the first post office in the Kumaon Hills where the legendary Jim Corbett's father was the post master. Now the family home of Mr & Mrs Bhargava, this `home-stay' offers 5 large well decorated rooms with attached bathroom.
