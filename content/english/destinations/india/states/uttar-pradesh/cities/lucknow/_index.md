Lucknow, the capital of Uttar Pradesh, extends along the banks of the River Gomti. The city, known earlier as Awadh, rapidly developed under the Mughal Emperor Akbar's patronage in the 16th century. Today, the city is dotted with remnants of its historic past. Lucknow is also known for its elaborate cuisine, traditional perfume and exquisite shadow-work embroidery on fine muslin cloth.
