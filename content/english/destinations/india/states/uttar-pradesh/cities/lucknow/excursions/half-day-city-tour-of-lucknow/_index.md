The Bara Imambara is a magnificent monument that recalls the glorious past of the nawabs. A remarkable feature is the absence of pillars supporting the vaulted main hall. The Chota Imambara is another fine monument from the time of the Nawabs. Nearby is Hussainabad Picture Gallery, with life-size portraits of the Nawabs of Avadh. The Residency was the scene of dramatic events during the mutiny of 1857. The scarred ruins tell the story of the British community besieged by the rebels.
