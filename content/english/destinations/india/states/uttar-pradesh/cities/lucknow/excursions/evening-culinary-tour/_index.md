Our culinary guide and driver will pick you up from your hotel to take you to a part of Lucknow which has a famous colony of chefs, called ‘Bawarchi Tola’. In this colony one may still find chefs whose forefathers used to cook a special kind of dish for the royals of Avadh. There is a street full of eateries where one can find the best from Lucknow’s very own traditional kitchens. You can hop in and out of these traditional roadside eateries to try a variety of different kinds of delicious local foods. This tour is essentially for meat lovers; a perfect opportunity to get a taste of the famous Awadhi cuisine! The tour operates daily except during Muslim festivals.
