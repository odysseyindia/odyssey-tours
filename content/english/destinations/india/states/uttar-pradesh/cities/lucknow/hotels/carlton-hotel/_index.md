A fabled Lucknow address, this converted old palace is set back from the road in its own well kept garden.  Its facade has  long corridors punctuated with pillars and arches. The 28 rooms are spacious and clean and there are three restaurants and a bar. Despite its air of somewhat faded grandeur, the hotel has a great character. Coupled with its central location, it makes for an attractive choice for a moderate traveller.
