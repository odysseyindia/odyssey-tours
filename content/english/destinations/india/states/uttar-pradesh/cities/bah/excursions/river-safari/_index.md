Set against a stunning backdrop, framed by the ravines and sandbanks, the calm waters of the Chambal River are best explored on boats. The gentle pace of the river safari is designed to provide spectacular sightings of the gharials, muggers & turtles basking in the sun, the many migratory and resident birds flying sorties, and the occasional glimpses of the Gangetic river dolphins breaking surface.
