The village of Bah lies near the ravines of the Chambal River, once known for gangs of bandits, but now for wonderful wildlife. Along the river, you will find the endangered gharial crocodile and Ganges dolphins, the mugger crocodile, turtles, and a huge array of bird species. The Bateshwar temples, scene of a large biennial fair in October-November, are also worth a visit for their location on the riverbank.
