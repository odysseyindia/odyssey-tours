Rishikesh is an ideal base for an exhilarating rafting trip on the River Ganges. No previous experience is necessary, and the trip passes beautiful scenery during the river descent from Shivpuri. So rather than staying in Rishikesh, you can drive for one hour and stay in the beautiful surroundings of Kaudhiyala in a deluxe tented camp on the banks of the Ganges.
