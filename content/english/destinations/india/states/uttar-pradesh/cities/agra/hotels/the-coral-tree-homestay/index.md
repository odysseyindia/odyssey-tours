This six-room home-stay is just a short walk away from the entrance to the Taj Mahal. The bright, cheerful rooms, verandahs and garden are all decorated with interesting pieces of art. The well-travelled owners are keen to interact with their guests, and are full of ideas to help you to get the most out of your time in Agra.
