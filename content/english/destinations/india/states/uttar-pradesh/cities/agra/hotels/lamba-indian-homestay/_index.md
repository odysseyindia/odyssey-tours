This family-run homestay is an oasis away from the hustle and bustle of Agra. Colonel Lamba and his wife are wonderful hosts who prepare fabulous food and warmly welcome you into their home.    The ten air-conditioned rooms have attached bathrooms and are all well appointed and spotlessly clean.     The homestay has internet access, guest laundry, a safety deposit box and a dining area. From the rooftop there is a distant view of the Taj Mahal.
