You travel from Delhi to Agra by the Gatimaan Express, which covers the 200km distance in less than 2 hours. An at-seat service of breakfast is included on-board. On arrival in Agra you will be met by your guide.     


In the morning you will visit the Taj Mahal, one of the most fascinating and beautiful monuments in the world. You can enjoy the gardens, the mausoleum and the mosque for about three hours. Don't miss the marble inlay work and the various vantage points offered throughout the peaceful gardens.    


After lunch, you visit Agra's Red Fort. Built in the form of a half moon on the Yamuna river, it is a masterpiece of design. The fort's colossal walls are encircled by a moat and contain a maze of buildings, that form a small city within a city.     


You will then transfer back to the railway station to board the return Gatimaan Express train to Delhi. Dinner is served on board.
