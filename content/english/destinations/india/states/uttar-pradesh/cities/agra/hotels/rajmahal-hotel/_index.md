Rajmahal Hotel has a quiet location, set back from the busy Mall Road, in an area of Agra currently being developed. The architecture and d√©cor are more impressive than many of Agra's hotels, which tend to be rather nondescript. The rooms are large, and are pleasantly furnished. There is a large comfortable lobby, and a small swimming pool. There are good views of the Taj Mahal from the rooftop, making this a good base for a short stay in Agra.
