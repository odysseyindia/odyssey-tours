This new mid range hotel has 30 modern, specious, comfortably furnished, rooms with wooden flooring and good natural light. On the rooftop there is a surprisingly pleasant swimming pool with sun loungers, and a bright cheerful restaurant open for lunch and dinner with a menu of Chinese and Mughlai dishes at reasonable prices, and a small bar, making this a very peasant place to spend time. There is even an upper platform with distant views of the Taj Mahal.
