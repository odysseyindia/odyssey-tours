Hotel Amar ia busy bustling property in a convenient location. Most of the rooms have recently been modernized. The restaurant serves excellent North Indian food, and there is a coffee shop next door.     The hotel has a garden with a swimming pool, a massage centre and gym. It is located behind the main building, away from the main road, and therefore a good place to relax.
