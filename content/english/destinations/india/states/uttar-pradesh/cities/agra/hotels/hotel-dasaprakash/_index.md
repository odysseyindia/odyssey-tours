Well known throughout India for their vegetarian restaurants, the Dasapraksh group's new hotel in Agra is bright and clean. The modern well equipped rooms, though small,  are comfortable. This is a simple place, but with an emphasis on efficiency, cleanliness and hygiene with can be lacking elsewhere in Agra. The busy restaurant is famous for its delicious South Indian food, and their ice cream sundaes are legendary.
