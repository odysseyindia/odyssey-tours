  - Early morning guided visit to the Taj
---
The best time of day to appreciate this stunning monument is as soon as the Taj Mahal opens, when it is at its quietest and most serene. Don't miss the marble inlay work and the various vantage points offered throughout the peaceful gardens.    You can carry mobile phones, cameras, a water bottle and valuables inside, but all other items must be deposited in safety lockers at the entry gate. You are then free to enter the grounds of the Taj Mahal for a maximum of three hours. Once you have taken it all in, you can return to your hotel for a late breakfast.
