Agra has much to offer besides the Taj Mahal, such as Agra Fort, a masterpiece of design and construction. You then visit Itimad-ud-Daulah's tomb - better known as the Baby Taj, which also features the same marble inlay work as the Taj Mahal. Finally you will visit Mehtab Bagh, a formally laid-out Mughal garden that offers stupendous views of the Taj Mahal, especially in the late afternoon.
