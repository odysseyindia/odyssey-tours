An hour outside Agra is the deserted Mughal city of Fatehpur Sikri, a complex of sandstone forts, palaces and mosques. Fatehpur Sikri was Emperor Akbar's capital for only 12 years before it was abandoned, apparently due to a lack of water. Today it is a ghost city, its architecture perfectly preserved. The white marble tomb of Sheikh Salim Chisti, Akbar's spiritual adviser, is a Muslim pilgrimage spot.
