This 100-year-old building is testimony to India's long and varied history. The low, white colonial building dating back to the Raj era is peppered with Mughal paintings and memorabilia, and was host at one time to the Crown Princes of England as well as to Mohammad Ali Jinnah. The wide lawn in the front, and the cupola-marked pool at the back complete the feel of a luxury heritage hotel.
