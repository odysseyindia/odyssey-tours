This new hotel in a residential area, but only a 10 minute walk for the River Ganges, is a clean, clam oasis in an otherwise chaotic city. The 11 rooms are of different shapes and sizes, but all are bright, modern, clean and comfortable. There is an attractive restaurant, a rooftop terrace, and an overall atmosphere of quiet efficiency often lacking elsewhere in Varanasi.
