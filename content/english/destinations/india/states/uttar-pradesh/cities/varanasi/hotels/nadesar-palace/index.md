Based in flower-filled gardens and adjoining golf greens, the Taj-run Nadesar Palace is a handsome building flanked by twin-columned verandahs. Almost next to the Palace is the small temple of Godess Nadeshwari, after whom the Palace is named. The rooms are peaceful and spacious, and the grounds offer a serene break from Varanasi's colourful chaos.
