Varanasi is one of the most important places for Hindus. It's believed that anyone who dies here will be liberated from the cycle of reincarnation, and bathing in the Ganges River is said to cleanse away all sins. The fascinating thing is that the rituals are conducted openly along the many riverside ghats, which are used for everything from bathing to burning the bodies of the dead. It is not the easiest city to appreciate as it is noisy, crowded and polluted, but it is certainly one of the most memorable places you will ever visit.
