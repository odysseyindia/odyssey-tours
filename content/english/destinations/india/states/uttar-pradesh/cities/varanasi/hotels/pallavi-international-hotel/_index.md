Varanasi's only heritage hotel. Pallavi is a low rise building - courtyards and meandering corridors lined  with old pieces of furniture reflecting the history of the place. There is a restaurant and a swimming pool in a garden. The 40 a/c rooms vary in size from small to moderately big and are simply furnished.
