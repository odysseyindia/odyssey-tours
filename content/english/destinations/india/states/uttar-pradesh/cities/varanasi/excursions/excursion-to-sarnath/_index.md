To the north of Varanasi, Sarnath is a peaceful contrast to the chaos of the city. It was here that Gautama Buddha preached his first sermon 2,500 years ago. The site is sacred to Buddhists and is now a major place of pilgrimage. Within a peaceful park are stupas and other ruins from the time of the Buddha. There is also a temple with paintings depicting the life of the Buddha on the walls. The Archeological Museum is worth a visit to view unique Buddhist masterpieces, and also on display is the famous Ashoka column, which features on all Indian banknotes.
