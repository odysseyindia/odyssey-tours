This renovated riverside palace has an unbeatable location, right on the banks of the River Ganges, just a 10 minute walk from the Old City. Some rooms have exceptional views of the River, which can also be enjoyed from the various terraces and the rooftop dining area. There is a peaceful meditation room.     Access is by boat from the ghats to the northern end of the City, making this a comfortable base for those who wish to fully immerse themselves in the life of Varanasi.
