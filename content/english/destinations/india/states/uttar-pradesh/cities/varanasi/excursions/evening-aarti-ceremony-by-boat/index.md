  - Evening aarti ceremony by boat
---
Every evening at dusk a spectacular ceremony takes place at the main Dashashwamedh Ghat. Priests sit on elevated platforms on the banks of the river and perform rituals dedicated to Lord Shiva. It is a photogenic, but also spiritual, experience, and the audience is mostly made up of pilgrims. The aarti ceremony lasts for around 45 minutes, and can be witnessed either from the banks of the river, or from a boat.     Note: During the monsoon months of July & August when the water level can be very high, the local authorities may suspend the boat rides for safety reasons. In such cases, we will observe the aarti ceremony from the ghats (the steps on the riverbank).
