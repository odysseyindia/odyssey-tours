    Early morning Ganges river boat trip followed by a short walk through the
    Old City
---
Your guide meets you at the hotel before sunrise, so you can watch the amazing Subah-e-Benares spectacle, which takes place on Varanasi's waterfront every morning. The principal attraction of Varanasi is the long string of bathing ghats by the river, where pilgrims make their sin-cleansing dip in the holy river and on which bodies are cremated. A boat ride on the Ganges at dawn, when it is full of pilgrims, is an amazing experience, and your guide can explain the various rituals taking place. Afterwards, you have a short walk through the Old City before returning to your hotel.
