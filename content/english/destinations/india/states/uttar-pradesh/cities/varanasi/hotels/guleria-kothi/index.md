This is one of the few high-quality hotels overlooking the Ganges. This magnificently-restored 18th-century riverfront house has 15 well-appointed rooms, most with good views. The Guleria Cafe outside the main entrance is a great place in the evenings. The easiest way to reach the hotel is to arrange a pick-up by the hotel boat from Raj Ghat, just a 10-minute ride. The boat ride for the evening Ganga aarti is complimentary.
