This functional new hotel has plain but large rooms with modern bathrooms. It is ideally located at Assi Ghat, the most clean and pleasant of Varanasi's riverside areas. There are good views over the river from the rooftop terrace restaurant, as well as pleasant cafes nearby, and daily sunrise and sunset ceremonies take place on the banks of the river.
