No hotel in Varanasi has a better location, high above the river close to the Main Ghat with fabulous views, best appreciated form the rooftop "Dolphin" restaurant. The rooms are plain and simple, though the best of these also enjoy the great views over the river. It can only be reached via the narrow lanes of the Old City, so you have to walk to get here, and there are many steep steps, but for those willing to forgo luxuries, the difficulty of access is more than made up for by the spectacular location.
