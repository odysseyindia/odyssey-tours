Hotel Vaibhav is quite a smart little establishment in the leafy Cantonment area, just north of Varanasi's railway station.     This 3-star hotel has sixty well-furnished rooms with Indian art on the walls and a green-themed restaurant which serves good Indian, Chinese and Western food. There is also a subterranean bar which can be enjoyed here.
