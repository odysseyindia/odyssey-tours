  - 'Early morning Ganges aarti, boat ride and walking tour'
---
Your guide meets you at the hotel before sunrise, so you can watch the amazing Subah-e-Benares spectacle, which takes place on Varanasi's waterfront every morning. The principal attraction of Varanasi is the long string of bathing ghats by the river, where pilgrims make their sin-cleansing dip in the holy river and on which bodies are cremated. A boat ride on the Ganges at dawn, when it is full of pilgrims, is an amazing experience, and your guide can explain the various rituals taking place.     Leaving the boat after passing the most important ghats, you then continue on foot for a fascinating exploration of the narrow lanes of the Bengali Tola area, one of the oldest continuously-inhabited places on earth, passing countless small temples, shrines, and traditional shops. Your guide will provide a unique insight into this most fascinating of cities. At the end of the walk, you return to the hotel for breakfast.     Note: During the monsoon months of July & August when the water level can be very high, the local authorities may suspend the boat rides for safety reasons. In such cases, we will provide an extended Heritage Walk in lieu of the boat ride.
