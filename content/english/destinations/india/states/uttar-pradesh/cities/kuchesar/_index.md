The Mud Fort of Kuchesar, just 75km east of Delhi in the state of Uttar Pradesh, was built in the mid 18th century. It is surrounded by a wide moat dug for defence. The surrounding areas are very rural with mango  orchards and fields of sugarcane. A small distance away are some ghats of the Ganges, ideal for a day picnic. Kuchesar is a perfect place to start or end your journey to/from the hills of Kumaon and Garhwal.
