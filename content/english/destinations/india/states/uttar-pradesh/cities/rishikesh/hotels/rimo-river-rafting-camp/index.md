Rimo Ganges Tented Camp is situated on a beautiful sandy beach by the river Ganges, an hour beyond Rishikesh. Accommodation is in deluxe twin-bedded safari tents, and is given out on full board basis.     A two night stay at the tented camp includes an exciting half-day rafting trip. No previous experience is necessary and rafting this section of the river Ganges is a great introduction for those who have not tried this activity before.
