The most plush hotel in Allahabad, Hotel Kanha Shyam is the hotel most prefered by large groups of foreigners and Indian business travellers.     A grand, sweeping lobby with glossy marble floors occupies the bottom floor of the hotel, and the rooms are located in the ascending stories of this tall, modern building.     The rooms are large but tend to be bland and now, slightly worn at the edges. There is a coffee shop, a traditional Indian restaurant and a rooftop bar overlooking all of Allahabad.
