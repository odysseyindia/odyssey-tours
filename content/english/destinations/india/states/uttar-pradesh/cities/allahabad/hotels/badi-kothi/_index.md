Close to the Ganga and Yamuna rivers, the heritage mansion of Badi Kothi is a landmark in this religious town. Recently restored, it offers a taste of the old zamindar (landed gentry) life with its stunning carved facade, courtyard and little terraces overlooking the town. The rooms are charming without overwhelming you with period touches, and there's a rooftop swimming pool to relax in.
