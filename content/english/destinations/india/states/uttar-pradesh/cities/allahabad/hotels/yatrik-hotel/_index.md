One of Allahabad's oldest hotels, Hotel Yatrik is a medium range hotel. Its rooms are well sized and recently renovated to be simple in style, yet comfortable with all the basic amenities.     Although situated in the heart of Allahabad Hotel Yatrik has a large lawn framed by bottle palms to relax in and a large pool which helps beat the dry summer heat of the city.     The rooms are all air conditioned and done up in pleasing shades of beige, green and blue.     The hotel is situated close to the down-town area and the upmarket shopping area of the Civil Lines.
