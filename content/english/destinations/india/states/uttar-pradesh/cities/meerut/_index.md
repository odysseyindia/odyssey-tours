Meerut, known to this day as the place where the Indian mutiny broke out in 1857, is a busy marketing, commercial and administrative town. Meerut reputedly produces 80% of the world's cricket equipment. Although the city is compact, the cantonment to the north is typically spaced out with some attractive broad, tree-lined streets. There is a fine Mall, the cemetery of St. John's and the old garrison Church.
