Vrindavan is a town in the Mathura district of Uttar Pradesh. It is the site of an ancient forest where, according to the Mahabharata, Lord Krishna spent his childhood days. The town is 10km from Mathura, the city of Lord Krishna's birth. The town hosts hundreds of temples dedicated to the worship of Radha and Krishna and is considered sacred by a number of Hindu religious traditions.
