          Delhi is practically two cities: New Delhi, the capital of India, and
          medieval Old Delhi. The old city centres around the Red Fort, which
          contains opulent palaces and impressive public buildings. Nearby is
          the magnificent Jama Masjid, India’s largest mosque. In New Delhi you
          can find India Gate - a war memorial arch, the impressive Parliament
          Building and Rashtrapati Bhawan, the residence of the President.
          Towards the South are Qutab Minar and Humayun’s Tomb, both World
          Heritage Sites.

          old-world charm and a lovely location.

        title: Morning guided tour of New Delhi
        content: >-
          New Delhi has a number of attractions, like Humayun’s Tomb, a
          sandstone mausoleum in the authentic Mughal style - the Taj Mahal,
          built much later, follows a similar style of architecture. Nearby you
          can see India Gate, the Parliament Buildings, the Lodhi Gardens, the
          Lotus Temple, the President’s House, and the Sikh temple, Gurudwara
          Bangla Sahib. However, Delhi is huge and traffic is usually heavy, and
          half a day is not enough to see all of the attractions, so it is best
          to discuss with your guide which sights you might wish to visit.


          The afternoon is free for you to relax or explore further on your own.

          Today, you drive to Jaipur, which takes about five hours along a good,
          if busy, highway, with time to just relax afterwards.


          The capital of the state of Rajasthan is one of the most interesting
          cities in India, with exuberant 18th- and 19th-century palaces and
          exotic street life. Just outside town is the impressive Amber Fort. It
          is worthwhile spending time wandering through the bazaars. Jaipur is
          well known for its beautiful carpets, enameled ornaments, precious and
          semi-precious stones, brass ornaments and many other arts and crafts.

          The rooms in the rambling building are well furnished with local
          hand-block printed fabrics and period furniture. The restaurant is
          decorated with exquisite frescoes. The pool area, with a bar and spa,
          is a very welcome area for relaxation. A genteel, luxurious option in
          Jaipur.

          To experience the life of the Pink City beyond the monuments, it is
          best to join a guided morning walk. Starting in the heart of the Old
          City, you will walk along the busy main streets, lined with parades of
          traditional shops, and explore smaller side streets, each devoted to
          different crafts.


          You will see various tradesmen, such as marble-sculptors and
          bangle-makers at work, visit local temples, see the colourful
          vegetable and flower markets, and sample delicious street foods, such
          as jalebis, rabri, kachoris, and lassi.

          Just to the north of Jaipur, Amber Fort overlooks the city from a spur
          of the Aravalli Hills. There is a short, steep walk up to the entrance
          courtyard, which leads to a magnificent complex of palaces, halls,
          pavilions, gardens and temples built over 125 years. There are
          excellent views down over the old town of Amer, and up to the Jaigarh
          and Nahargarh Forts higher in the hills.

          A four-hour drive takes you to the small and picturesque village of
          Barli, south of Ajmer, centred around the Barli Fort, which dates back
          to 1675. It has been under its present ownership for sixteen
          generations, and has recently been renovated as a charming heritage
          hotel by the family who own it. Barli offers a good opportunity to
          enjoy peaceful rural life.

        content: >-
          It is great fun to explore the village of Barli by bullock cart. As
          you make your way through the narrow streets, you will receive a
          friendly greeting from all the inhabitants, especially the children.
          You can see traditional potters and shoe-makers at work, visit a local
          temple, and see the memorials to local rulers. It is a great insight
          into the traditional lifestyles still followed by people throughout
          rural India.

          relive the days of the Maharajas and explore the village and
          countryside in comfort. A big highlight is the food, exceptionally
          tasty and lavishly laid out (ask for the ‘jungli maas’, a simple but
          toothsome meat recipe from the days of hunting parties).

          You travel to Jodhpur at the edge of the Thar desert, about a
          four-hour drive.


          Jodhpur is dominated by the massive Meherangarh Fort, which houses an
          excellent museum and affords captivating views of the blue Brahmin
          houses of the old city. The clock tower is a popular landmark in the
          old city. Narrow alleys lead from here to bazaars for textiles, silver
          and handicrafts. It’s a fascinating jumble of winding streets, of
          great interest to wander around in the evening.

          rooms are air-conditioned and imaginatively furnished, mixing Raj
          splendour with a contemporary twist. There is a garden restaurant and

        title: Morning audio-guide tour of Jodhpur's Meherangarh Fort
        content: >-
          Perched on a hilltop dominating the city, Meherangarh Fort is the most
          visually spectacular in Rajasthan. It is approached by a series of
          seven gateways set at an angle to hinder invading armies. Past the
          gates, the fort-palace has huge courtyards surrounded by wings of
          palatial buildings, part of which is now turned into a fabulous
          museum. An excellent audio tour is included in the entrance fee, and
          this leads you through the museum within the Fort.


          Afterwards, it is well worth exploring the ramparts of the fort, with
          their superb views. The Jaswant Thada memorial lies on the approach to
          the Fort, and the large white marble structure is surrounded by the
          cremation grounds of former rulers.


          The afternoon is at leisure to further explore Jodhpur on your own.

          After breakfast, drive to the little village of Narlai, at the foot of
          a gigantic single 350-foot granite rock, dotted with caves and
          temples. The village has a beautifully-restored 17th-century hunting
          lodge. This small haveli lies cozily within fortress-like walls and
          the whitewashed terraces offer views of the hill with its dramatic
          huge granite boulder.

          This former hunting lodge is now a charming heritage hotel. The rooms
          and suites are all delightfully different from each other, with local
          Rajasthani furniture. There is a large, well-maintained courtyard lawn
          bordered by flaming bougainvillea, and an immaculate swimming pool,
          making this a wonderful place to break your journey, and to explore
          the surrounding village and its attractive boulder-strewn landscape.


          One of the most spectacular experiences at Narlai (or anywhere) is the
          beautiful, lamp-lit step-well dinner, a must for a romantic stay.

          Each morning, a staff member from Rawla Narlai accompanies guests on a
          walk through the surrounding village. Narlai is a very close-knit
          community, and people still live in a traditional way. During the walk
          you can go inside some of the village houses, meet the local people,
          and find out more about their lives.


          The afternoon is at leisure to relax or try the activities at Rawla
          Narlai. You can go horse-riding, trekking or on a leopard safari; all
          these activities can be booked directly at the hotel.

          amazing Kumbhalgarh Fort, home to the second-longest wall in the world
          after China.


          You end the day at Deogarh, a pleasant, little-frequented town north
          of Udaipur. The market is dotted with shops selling silver jewellery,
          clothes, fabrics, food stuffs and just about everything one needs in a
          Rajasthani household. The road winds its way up to the top of the hill
          up to the beautifully renovated Deogarh Mahal Palace.

          The rooms are spread across the palace on different, maze-like levels.
          Many rooms have original furniture and some have exquisite frescoes
          and murals with mirrors. Beautiful handpicked fabrics enhance a
          feeling of quiet elegance. There is a well-designed swimming pool in
          its own secluded area.

          cinematic landscape. On board, you get to interact with locals who are
          excited to sit next to a foreigner; the bonus is monkeys and peacocks
          on the way. The ride ends at Phulad and then you drive back to Deogarh
          along a very scenic route.


          The rest of the day is at leisure to explore the palace and the
          village.

          Udaipur is surely Rajasthan’s most picturesque city. High whitewashed
          houses and narrow, winding alleys lend it an almost medieval charm.
          The huge City Palace, still the residence of the Maharana, is carved
          out of yellow sandstone and stands on the banks of Lake Pichola, from
          where you have fabulous views over the lake and the famous Lake Palace

Rajasthan’s castles aren’t just romantic fortresses - they’re often at the heart of villages, still as relevant to the communities as they were 300 years ago. Best of all, they’re all unique, from the huge, maze-like fortress of Deogarh to the romantic lakeside palaces in Udaipur and the intimate fort at Barli. You’ll also stay in old royal hunting lodges, from the opulent Ajit Bhawan in Jodhpur to laidback Rawla Narlai, for a taste of the royal life.
