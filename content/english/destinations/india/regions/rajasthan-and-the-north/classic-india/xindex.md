Day 1, Delhi
Today, you start your tour on arrival in Delhi, where you will be met by our representative and transferred to your hotel.

Delhi is practically two cities: New Delhi, the capital of India, and medieval Old Delhi. The old city centres around the Red Fort, which contains opulent palaces and impressive public buildings. Nearby is the magnificent Jama Masjid, India’s largest mosque. In New Delhi you can find India Gate - a war memorial arch, the impressive Parliament Building and Rashtrapati Bhawan, the residence of the President. Towards the South are Qutab Minar and Humayun's Tomb, both World Heritage Sites.

 
Suggested hotel: COLONEL'S RETREAT
Colonel's Retreat is a very pleasant and homely guest house in an upmarket, tree-lined neighborhood. The large rooms are comfortable and artistically furnished. Each floor boasts a lovely lounge area with comfortable sofas for relaxing, books to read and borrow, and computers. A private rooftop dining area gives you a lovely view of the city.


Day 2, Delhi

MORNING TOUR OF OLD DELHI BY METRO & RICKSHAW
A half-day tour to Old Delhi using the modern Metro and the traditional cycle rickshaw. The Metro brings you to the heart of Old Delhi in just a few minutes, to visit the magnificent Jama Masjid mosque, India's largest. You then use walk and ride cycle rickshaws through the fascinating maze of narrow streets around the main street of Old Delhi, Chandni Chowk, a bustling jumble of craft shops, traders, mosques and temples. 

At one end of this street is the huge Red Fort, the symbol of Delhi, which contains within it palaces and impressive public buildings. (Please note, though, that we will not go inside the Red Fort, because on this tour we concentrate on the narrow alleys and atmosphere of Old Delhi. However, you could arrange with your local guide to see the Red Fort at the end of your half-day tour). At the other end of Chandni Chowk is the colourful and aromatic Spice Market, the roof of which offers great views over Old Delhi. You can also visit the bustling and colourful Sikh Gurdwara. 
	
The rest of your day is at leisure. If you'd like to go shopping or explore a bit more after the tour, you can take the Metro to vibrant Connaught Place to enjoy the many restaurants and more modern shops.


Day 3, Jaipur

Today, you drive to Jaipur, which takes about five hours along a good, if busy, highway, with time to just relax afterwards. 

The capital of the state of Rajasthan is one of the most interesting cities in India, with exuberant 18th- and 19th-century palaces and exotic street life. Just outside town is the impressive Amber Fort. It is worthwhile spending time wandering through the bazaars. Jaipur is well known for its beautiful carpets, enameled ornaments, precious and semi-precious stones, brass ornaments and many other arts and crafts.


Suggested hotel: DERA RAWATSAR
Dera Rawatsar is a family-run boutique hotel, warm as a home. Located just behind the bus station, Dera Rawatsar lies in a quiet, leafy lane. Within its walls are small courtyards and terraces, lawns and secluded corners. The well-decorated and traditionally-furnished rooms are all different. Meals, drinks and snacks are served in the family's dining room or the outdoor courtyard. There is also a small swimming pool.


Day 4, Jaipur
EARLY MORNING CYCLE TOUR OF JAIPUR
In the early morning, you join a small group for a unique journey by bicycle into the streets of the old city. You will experience the true Jaipur as you cycle through the narrow alleys to get a peek into homes, kitchens and workshops. You learn about the lives of the locals and the history of the city, and visit the colourful and bustling vegetable and flower markets. You will also enjoy a traditional Rajasthani breakfast in a local house.

MORNING GUIDED EXCURSION TO AMBER FORT
You will meet your guide directly after the cycling tour, who will accompany you to Amber Fort, just to the north of Jaipur. There is a short, steep walk up to the entrance courtyard, which leads to a magnificent complex of palaces, halls, pavilions, gardens and temples built over 125 years. There are excellent views down over the old town of Amer, and up to the Jaigarh and Nahargarh Forts higher in the hills.

The rest of your day is at leisure to explore Jaipur's lovely markets on your own.


Day 5, Agra

Today, you have a long drive to Agra, but with some very interesting optional stops along the way, at the huge Abhaneri step-well, Bharatpur bird sanctuary and the grand folly of Fatehpur Sikri. Depending on the stops you make, the drive takes from five hours to most of the day.
 
AGRA
Agra is home to possibly the most famous and beautiful building in the world: the Taj Mahal, built in the 17th century by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan as a tomb and memorial for his wife Mumtaz Mahal. Along the river Yamuna is the impressive Red Fort, the capital of the Mughal Empire during the 16th and 17th centuries.

Suggested hotel: THE CORAL TREE HOMESTAY
This six-room home-stay is just a short walk away from the entrance to the Taj Mahal. The bright, cheerful rooms, verandahs and garden are all decorated with interesting pieces of art. The well-travelled owners are keen to interact with their guests, and are full of ideas to help you to get the most out of your time in Agra. 


Day 6, Agra

EARLY MORNING VISIT ON YOUR OWN TO THE TAJ MAHAL 
The best time of day to appreciate this stunning monument is as soon as the Taj Mahal opens, when it is at its quietest and most serene. You can enjoy the gardens, the mausoleum and the mosque, without needing a professional guide. Don't miss the marble inlay work and the various vantage points offered throughout the peaceful gardens. Once you have taken it all in, you can return to your hotel for a late breakfast.

AFTERNOON GUIDED TOUR OF AGRA'S OTHER MONUMENTS
Agra has much to offer besides the Taj Mahal, such as Agra Fort, a masterpiece of design and construction. You then visit Itimad-ud-Daulah's tomb - better known as the Baby Taj, which also features the same marble inlay work as the Taj Mahal. Finally you will visit Mehtab Bagh, a formally laid-out Mughal garden that offers stupendous views of the Taj Mahal, especially in the late afternoon. 


Day 7, Orchha
An early-morning train and a short drive take you to tiny Orchha, in northern Madhya Pradesh. This medieval town is an architectural gem: during the 16th and 17th centuries, this was the capital of the Bundela dynasty, who built a palace on a small river island, followed by other magnificent palaces and temples. It is now a peaceful and easygoing place - perfect for relaxation and exploration of the ruins.

AFTERNOON TOUR OF ORCHHA
The huge monuments of the Bundela kings surround and dwarf the small village of Orchha. The largest is the palace complex, where the Raj Mahal and Jehangir Mahal boast a unique combination of Hindu & Muslim architecture, with painted decorations and tile-work. The Laxmi Temple has more modern artwork and beautiful murals. The vast, cathedral-like Chaturbhuj temple and the active Ram Raja Temple in the colourful market area are popular with local worshippers, and the grand cenotaphs overlook the Betwa River, which is used by the locals for bathing.
	
Suggested hotel: AMAR MAHAL
Built to resemble Orchha's palaces of the distinctive 'Bundela' style, Amar Mahal is a low white building with open lawns, with comfortable rooms surrounding a large swimming pool. Its gardens have an unrestricted view of the famous royal cenotaphs and there are plenty of comfortable outdoor spots in which to relax in and enjoy the sense of space and peace.

	
Day 8, Khajuraho
Today, you drive through the central Indian countryside for about four hours to Khajuraho, world-renowned for its intricately-carved temples. The temples are best known for their erotic sculptures, running through a whole Kamasutra of positions and possibilities that leave little to the imagination, but in fact, most of the carvings are of celestial figures, delicate and graceful, and well worth the visit.
 
Suggested hotel: RAMADA KHAJURAHO
The Ramada has pleasant interiors of cool white-marble elegance with chandeliers in the lobby, curving white staircases, and well-chosen Indian antiques throughout. The modern rooms are decorated in soft cream shades and rich fabrics, and have large bay windows, with views of either the central swimming pool, or the garden that surrounds the property, making this a peaceful place to relax.
	

Day 9, Khajuraho

MORNING GUIDED TOUR OF KHAJURAHO'S TEMPLES
Of the original eighty five temples, twenty five remain today, with the largest and best preserved, the main Western Group of Temples, in a well-tended garden. The sculptures are sublime and sensuous at the same time. They adorn the temple walls, depicting themes of celestial nymphs, ascetics in penance, hunting and war scenes, group dances and royal processions. It is also worth visiting the smaller Eastern Group of Temples, also known as the Jain Temples, which, whilst much smaller, boast some of the most refined stone carving.

The afternoon is at leisure to explore this quiet town on your own.


Day 10, Varanasi

A short flight takes you to Varanasi, one of the most important places for Hindus: it's believed that anyone who dies here will be liberated from the cycle of reincarnation, and bathing in the Ganges River is said to cleanse away all sins. The fascinating thing is that the rituals are conducted openly along the many riverside ghats, which are used for everything from bathing to burning the bodies of the dead. It is not the easiest city to appreciate as it is noisy and crowded, but it is certainly one of the most memorable places you will ever visit.

Varanasi's riverside ghats are fabulous for exploring on your own - the rest of the day is free for you to walk around and absorb the unique atmosphere.

Suggested hotel: HOTEL GANGES VIEW
Staying in hotel Ganges View feels more like staying in a grand historic home with a wonderful traditional and spiritual feel. Much of the furniture is antique, there are various shrines, and historic paintings and religious items decorate the many lounges and terraces. The overall effect is of peaceful contemplation, offering a more in depth understanding of the history and culture of this pilgrimage city.


Day 11, Varanasi

EARLY MORNING GANGES AARTI, BOAT RIDE AND WALKING TOUR
Your guide meets you at the hotel before sunrise, so you can watch the amazing Subah-e-Benares spectacle, which takes place on Varanasi's waterfront every morning. The principal attraction of Varanasi is the long string of bathing ghats by the river, where pilgrims make their sin-cleansing dip in the holy river and on which bodies are cremated. A boat ride on the Ganges at dawn, when it is full of pilgrims, is an amazing experience, and your guide can explain the various rituals taking place.

Leaving the boat after passing the most important ghats, you then continue on foot for a fascinating exploration of the narrow lanes of the Bengali Tola area, one of the oldest continuously-inhabited places on earth, passing countless small temples, shrines, and traditional shops. Your guide will provide a unique insight into this most fascinating of cities. At the end of the walk, you return to the hotel for breakfast.    


The remainder of the day is at leisure to further explore Varanasi on your own.
