          Delhi is practically two cities: New Delhi, the capital of India, and
          medieval Old Delhi. The old city centres around the Red Fort, which
          contains opulent palaces and impressive public buildings. Nearby is
          the magnificent Jama Masjid, India’s largest mosque. In New Delhi you
          can find India Gate - a war memorial arch, the impressive Parliament
          Building and Rashtrapati Bhawan, the residence of the President.
          Towards the South are Qutab Minar and Humayun’s Tomb, both World
          Heritage Sites.

        content: >-
          A half-day tour to Old Delhi using the modern Metro and the
          traditional cycle rickshaw. The Metro brings you to the heart of Old
          Delhi in just a few minutes, to visit the magnificent Jama Masjid
          mosque, India’s largest. You then use walk and ride cycle rickshaws
          through the fascinating maze of narrow streets around the main street
          of Old Delhi, Chandni Chowk, a bustling jumble of craft shops,
          traders, mosques and temples.


          At one end of this street is the huge Red Fort, the symbol of Delhi,
          which contains within it palaces and impressive public buildings.
          (Please note, though, that we will not go inside the Red Fort, because
          on this tour we concentrate on the narrow alleys and atmosphere of Old
          Delhi. However, you could arrange with your local guide to see the Red
          Fort at the end of your half-day tour). At the other end of Chandni
          Chowk is the colourful and aromatic Spice Market, the roof of which
          offers great views over Old Delhi. You can also visit the bustling and
          colourful Sikh Gurdwara.


          The rest of your day is at leisure. If you’d like to go shopping or
          explore a bit more after the tour, you can take the Metro to vibrant
          Connaught Place to enjoy the many restaurants and more modern shops.

          Today, you drive to Jaipur, which takes about five hours along a good,
          if busy, highway, with time to just relax afterwards.


          Jaipur is one of the most interesting cities in India, with exuberant
          18th- and 19th-century palaces and exotic street life. Just outside
          town is the impressive Amber Fort. It is worthwhile spending time
          wandering through the bazaars. Jaipur is well known for its beautiful
          carpets, enameled ornaments, precious and semi-precious stones, brass
          ornaments and many other arts and crafts.

          Dera Rawatsar is a family-run boutique hotel, warm as a home. Located
          just behind the bus station, Dera Rawatsar lies in a quiet, leafy
          lane. Within its walls are small courtyards and terraces, lawns and
          secluded corners. The well-decorated and traditionally-furnished rooms
          are all different. Meals, drinks and snacks are served in the family’s
          dining room or the outdoor courtyard. There is also a small swimming
          pool.

          In the early morning, you join a small group of like-minded travellers
          for a unique journey by bicycle into the streets of the old city. You
          experience the true Jaipur, as you cycle through the narrow alleys to
          get a peek into homes, kitchens and workshops. You learn about the
          lives of the locals and the history of the city, and visit the
          colourful and bustling vegetable and flower markets. You also enjoy a
          traditional Rajasthani breakfast in a local house.

          You will meet your guide directly after the cycling tour, who will
          accompany you to Amber Fort, just to the north of Jaipur. There is a
          short, steep walk up to the entrance courtyard, which leads to a
          magnificent complex of palaces, halls, pavilions, gardens and temples
          built over 125 years. There are excellent views down over the old town
          of Amer, and up to the Jaigarh and Nahargarh Forts higher in the
          hills.


          The rest of your day is at leisure to explore Jaipur’s lovely markets
          on your own.

          Today, you have a long drive to Agra, but with some very interesting
          optional stops along the way, at the huge Abhaneri step-well,
          Bharatpur bird sanctuary and the grand folly of Fatehpur Sikri.
          Depending on the stops you make, the drive takes from five hours to
          most of the day.


          Agra is home to possibly the most famous and beautiful building in the
          world: the Taj Mahal, built in the 17th century by the Mughal emperor
          Shah Jahan as a tomb and memorial for his wife Mumtaz Mahal. Along the
          river Yamuna is the impressive Red Fort, the capital of the Mughal
          Empire during the 16th and 17th centuries.

          all decorated with interesting pieces of art. The well-travelled
          owners are keen to interact with their guests, and are full of ideas
          to help you to get the most out of your time in Agra.

          The best time of day to appreciate this stunning monument is as soon
          as the Taj Mahal opens, when it is at its quietest and most serene.
          You can enjoy the gardens, the mausoleum and the mosque, without
          needing a professional guide. Don’t miss the marble inlay work and the
          various vantage points offered throughout the peaceful gardens. Once
          you have taken it all in, you can return to your hotel for a late
          breakfast.

          The Taj Mahal is one of the most fascinating and beautiful monuments
          in the world. About 20,000 workers were employed in its construction,
          which took some 20 years. Agra’s Red Fort, built in the form of a half
          moon on the Yamuna river, is a masterpiece of design. The fort’s
          colossal walls are encircled by a moat and contain a maze of
          buildings, that form a small city within a city. You visit both on a
          half-day guided tour.

          An early-morning train and a short drive take you to tiny Orchha, in
          northern Madhya Pradesh. This medieval town is an architectural gem:
          during the 16th and 17th centuries, this was the capital of the
          Bundela dynasty, who built a palace on a small river island, followed
          by other magnificent palaces and temples. It is now a peaceful and
          easygoing place - perfect for relaxation and exploration of the ruins.

          The huge monuments of the Bundela kings surround, and dwarf, the small
          village of Orchha. The largest is the Palace complex, where the Raj
          Mahal and Jehangir Mahal boast a unique combination of Hindu & Muslim
          architecture, with painted decorations and tile work. The Laxmi Temple
          has more modern artwork. The vast, cathedral-like Chaturbhuj temple
          and the active Ram Raja Temple in the colourful market area are
          popular with local worshippers, and the grand cenotaphs overlook the
          Betwa River, which is used by the locals for bathing.

          Amar Mahal is a low white building with open lawns, with comfortable
          rooms surrounding a large swimming pool. Its gardens have an
          unrestricted view of the famous royal cenotaphs and there are plenty
          of comfortable outdoor spots in which to relax in and enjoy the sense
          of space and peace.

          Khajuraho, a tiny village in the state of Madhya Pradesh, is
          world-renowned for the intricately-carved temples - for which there is
          probably no equivalent in the world - where sculptures celebrate the
          joy of life and love. Stone figures of celestial maidens appear on
          every temple. In between are erotic figures running through a whole
          Kamasutra of positions and possibilities whereby little is left to
          imagination.

          Of the original eighty five temples, twenty five remain today, with
          the largest and best preserved, the main Western Group of Temples, in
          a well-tended garden. The sculptures are sublime and sensuous at the
          same time. They adorn the temple walls, depicting themes of celestial
          nymphs, ascetics in penance, hunting and war scenes, group dances and
          royal processions. It is also worth visiting the smaller Eastern Group
          of Temples, also known as the Jain Temples, which, whilst much
          smaller, boast some of the most refined stone carving.

          A short flight takes you to Varanasi, one of the most important places
          for Hindus: it’s believed that anyone who dies here will be liberated
          from the cycle of reincarnation, and bathing in the Ganges River is
          said to cleanse away all sins. The fascinating thing is that the
          rituals are conducted openly along the many riverside ghats, which are
          used for everything from bathing to burning the bodies of the dead. It
          is not the easiest city to appreciate as it is noisy and crowded, but
          it is certainly one of the most memorable places you will ever visit.


          Varanasi’s riverside ghats are fabulous for exploring on your own -
          the rest of the day is free for you to walk around and absorb the
          unique atmosphere.

          paintings and religious items decorate the many lounges and terraces.
          The overall effect is of peaceful contemplation, offering a more in
          depth understanding of the history and culture of this pilgrimage
          city.

A classic adventure in northern India. The journey includes the palaces of Jaipur, the immortal beauty of the Taj Mahal, the medieval temple town of Orchha, the erotic statues of Khajuraho and sunrise over the sacred Ganges. A boat ride on the Ganges at dawn, when it is full of pilgrims making their sin-cleansing dip in the holy river, is an amazing experience.

### Highlights:
* Cycling and visiting Amber Fort in Jaipur
* An early-morning trip to the Taj Mahal
* Huge forts, cenotaphs and temples in Orchha
* Beautiful (not just erotic) carvings in Khajuraho
* The holy city of Varanasi on the banks of the Ganges
