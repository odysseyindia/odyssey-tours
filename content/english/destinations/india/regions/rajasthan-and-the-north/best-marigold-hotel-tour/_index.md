          A two-hour flight today takes you to lovely Udaipur.


          Set around the vast Pichola Lake and dominated by dramatic palaces,
          Udaipur is surely Rajasthan’s most picturesque city. High whitewashed
          houses and narrow, winding alleys lend it an almost medieval charm.
          The huge City Palace, still the residence of the Maharana, is carved
          out of yellow sandstone and stands on the banks of Lake Pichola, from
          where you have fabulous views over the lake and the famous Lake Palace
          Hotel.

          The whitewashed walls and plants create an atmosphere of pure
          relaxation and tranquility in this otherwise busy area. The rooms
          differ in size and decor, but are all attractive, with local fabrics
          and antique furniture. Most do not have lake views, but the many
          terraces, the rooftop pool and the restaurant all have excellent views
          of Lake Pichola.

        content: >-
          The highlight of this guided city tour is a visit to the City Palace,
          now largely preserved as a museum with a large and varied collection
          of mosaics, glass and porcelain figures, miniatures and paintings.
          There are superb views over Lake Pichola and the Lake Palace Hotel.
          Nearby is the 17th-century Jagdish temple, famous for its superb and
          distinctive architecture and a centre of constant activity.


          The city tour is followed by a relaxing, hour-long (shared) motor boat
          ride on the lake, with views of the activity on the “ghats” used by
          local people for washing and bathing, the City Palace complex, and the
          Aravalli Hills to the west. You also pass the famous luxury Lake
          Palace hotel, and stop to visit the serene “pleasure island” of Jag
          Mandir.


          Your afternoon is at leisure. We recommend a gin & tonic on the
          terrace overlooking the lake in Udaipur!

          An hour’s drive east of Udaipur is the little village of Khempur, set
          amid mustard and millet fields. At the edge of the village is Ravla
          Khempur, now a heritage hotel, famous in film as the Best Exotic
          Marigold Hotel. Khempur is also famous for its beautiful Marwari
          horses. A stay here therefore offers the opportunity to explore the
          Indian countryside on horseback.

          Ravla Khempur is a grand, two-storey haveli, pale yellow in colour,
          with arched windows trimmed with ornate white carvings. With a history
          dating to the early 17th century, the palace was once famed for its
          stable of fine Marwari horses and is still home to dancing stallions,
          which perform when requested in front of the magnificent turreted
          building. A large neem tree shades the family temple next to the fort.

          Today, you drive to the colossal hilltop fort of Chittaurgarh, the
          ancient capital of Mewar state. Thrice in its long history,
          Chittaurgarh was sacked by a stronger enemy, and on each occasion the
          men rode out to certain death, while the women committed johar by
          throwing themselves and their children onto a huge funeral pyre. The
          immense stretch of Chittaurgarh’s walls and ruined palaces relate the
          saga of innumerable sieges and heroism.

          Chittaurgarh. It is home to the 200-year-old Castle Bijaipur, now
          converted into a heritage hotel. Use this destination to recharge your
          batteries by relaxing at the outdoor pool, or rent a bicycle to
          explore the region. The country roads are fairly empty apart from farm
          vehicles and many shepherds with their cattle or flocks of sheep.

          swimming pool where you can relax. If you feel more energetic, you can
          explore the village, lakeside and nearby forts by cycle, horse or
          jeep, or go trekking in the surrounding hills.

          safari, horse riding, cycling, trekking, bird watching and village
          walks. They will also put on cooking demos, organise yoga classes, and

          Today, you get to treat yourself to some understated luxury. You drive
          under three hours to Shahpura Bagh, a 120-year-old estate, set in 45
          acres of garden and pasture and surrounded by lakes, and now a
          wonderful boutique hotel.


          There is an interesting step-well just outside the Bagh walls and a
          temple with some excellent marble carvings, surrounded by a colourful
          market.

          Located in an orchard of rare beauty, and run by exceptionally amiable
          hosts, Shahpura Bagh is a real treat. This was the summer residence of
          the rulers of Shahpura and is now a fine heritage hotel with
          beautifully furnished rooms.


          The owners organise excursions to a nearby fort and to their eco-farm.
          Most guests, though, find it difficult to leave the delightful
          swimming pool! An ideal spot for relaxation and light activity.

          Though Shahpura Bagh is perfect for total indolence, it also offers a
          number of activities, like visits to the nearby village and market. To
          understand the local culture, sit with the joshis (priests) and watch
          a traditional phad, a painting depicting mythology and history, come
          to life.


          You can also go on jeep or cycle safaris, a bullock cart ride with an
          outdoor breakfast, visit a school, or have a sundowner at the family’s
          private fort. You can book all of these directly at the hotel.

          A four-hour drive takes you to Jaipur, one of the most interesting
          cities in India, with exuberant 18th- and 19th-century palaces and
          exotic street life. Just outside town is the impressive Amber Fort. It
          is worthwhile spending time wandering through the bazaars. Jaipur is
          well known for its beautiful carpets, enameled ornaments, precious and
          semi-precious stones, brass ornaments and many other arts and crafts.


          Your afternoon is free to just relax. You spend the evening at Castle
          Kanota, the filming location for the exclusive ‘Viceroy’s Club’
          featured in both movies.

          Just off a busy street near the old walled city, Alsisar Haveli offers
          peace and serenity once you step through the arched gateway. Most of
          the aristocratic families, loyal to the royal house of Jaipur,
          maintained lavish town-houses in Jaipur. Alsisar Haveli is one such
          property. The current head of the family has sympathetically restored
          the old haveli, which now has a lovely swimming pool in a large,
          peaceful garden.

          As one of the major locations used in the movie, Jaipur has plenty of
          sights and scenes you will find familiar. To explore the Pink City, it
          is best to join a guided morning walk. You will walk along the busy
          main streets, lined with parades of traditional shops, and explore
          smaller side streets, each devoted to different crafts.


          You will see various tradesmen, such as marble-sculptors and
          angle-makers at work, visit local temples, see the colourful vegetable
          and flower markets, and sample delicious street foods, such as
          jalebis, rabri, kachoris, and lassi.

          courtyard, which leads to a magnificent complex of palaces, halls,
          pavilions, gardens and temples built over 125 years. There are
          excellent views down over the old town of Amer, and up to the Jaigarh
          and Nahargarh Forts higher in the hills.

        title: Agra
        content: >-
          Today, you have a long drive to Agra, but with some very interesting
          optional stops along the way, at the huge Abhaneri step-well,
          Bharatpur bird sanctuary and the grand folly of Fatehpur Sikri.
          Depending on the stops you make, the drive takes from five hours to
          most of the day.


          Agra is home to possibly the most famous and beautiful building in the
          world: the Taj Mahal, built in the 17th century by the Mughal emperor
          Shah Jahan as a tomb and memorial for his wife Mumtaz Mahal. Along the
          river Yamuna is the impressive Red Fort, the capital of the Mughal
          Empire during the 16th and 17th centuries.

          This 100-year-old building is testimony to India’s long and varied
          history. The low, white colonial building dating back to the Raj era
          is peppered with Mughal paintings and memorabilia, and was host at one
          time to the Crown Princes of England as well as to Mohammad Ali
          Jinnah. The wide lawn in the front, and the cupola-marked pool at the
          back complete the feel of a luxury heritage hotel.

          The best time of day to appreciate this stunning monument is as soon
          as the Taj Mahal opens, when it is at its quietest and most serene.
          You can enjoy the gardens, the mausoleum and the mosque, without
          needing a professional guide. Don’t miss the marble inlay work and the
          various vantage points offered throughout the peaceful gardens.


          Once you have taken it all in, you can return to your hotel for a late
          breakfast.

          Itimad-ud-Daulah’s tomb - better known as the Baby Taj, which also
          features the same marble inlay work as the Taj Mahal. Finally you will
          visit Mehtab Bagh, a formally laid-out Mughal garden that offers

          Delhi is practically two cities: New Delhi, the capital of India, and

          contains opulent palaces and impressive public buildings. Nearby is
          the magnificent Jama Masjid, India’s largest mosque. In New Delhi you
          can find India Gate - a war memorial arch, the impressive Parliament
          Building and Rashtrapati Bhawan, the residence of the President.
          Towards the South are Qutab Minar and Humayun’s Tomb, both World

This quirky, cheerful movie and its sequel had everyone wondering: where on Earth is this place, exactly? Well, it’s not one place, it’s several - and on this tour you can visit all of them, and all while getting to know a lovely, offbeat part of India. You will get to stay at the main location at Rawla Khempur, plus smaller ones in Jaipur and Kanota, and stay at Jagat Niwas Palace in Udaipur, also featured in the movie, with views over the famous Lake Palace. As you also visit other offbeat destinations, like lovely Shahpura and the striking Castle Bijaipur, this is a very enjoyable, different tour - even if you aren’t a movie buff!
