          A two-hour flight takes you to lovely Udaipur. Set around the vast
          Pichola Lake and dominated by dramatic palaces, Udaipur is surely
          Rajasthan's most picturesque city. High whitewashed houses and narrow,
          winding alleys lend it an almost medieval charm. The huge City Palace,
          still the residence of the Maharana, is carved out of yellow sandstone
          and stands on the banks of Lake Pichola, from where you have fabulous
          views over the lake and the famous Lake Palace Hotel.

          A delightful 17th-century haveli, right on the banks of Lake Pichola.
          The whitewashed walls and plants create an atmosphere of pure
          relaxation and tranquility in this otherwise busy area. The rooms
          differ in size and decor, but are all attractive, with local fabrics
          and antique furniture. Most do not have lake views, but the many
          terraces, the rooftop pool and the restaurant all have excellent views
          of Lake Pichola.

          The highlight of this guided city tour is a visit to the City Palace,
          now largely preserved as a museum with a large and varied collection
          of mosaics, glass and porcelain figures, miniatures and paintings.
          There are superb views over Lake Pichola and the Lake Palace Hotel.
          Nearby is the 17th-century Jagdish temple, famous for its superb and
          distinctive architecture and a centre of constant activity.


          The city tour is followed by a relaxing, hour-long (shared) motor boat
          ride on the lake, with views of the activity on the “ghats” used by
          local people for washing and bathing, the City Palace complex, and the
          Aravalli Hills to the west. You also pass the famous luxury Lake
          Palace hotel, and stop to visit the serene “pleasure island” of Jag
          Mandir.


          Your afternoon is at leisure. We recommend a gin & tonic on the
          terrace overlooking the lake in Udaipur!

          An hour’s drive east of Udaipur is the little village of Khempur, set
          amid mustard and millet fields. At the edge of the village is Ravla
          Khempur, now a heritage hotel, famous in film as the Best Exotic
          Marigold Hotel. A large neem tree shades the family temple next to the
          fort. Khempur is famous for its beautiful Marwari horses. A stay here
          therefore offers the opportunity to explore the Indian countryside on
          horseback.

          Ravla Khempur is a grand, two-storey haveli, pale yellow in colour,
          with arched windows trimmed with ornate white carvings. This was the
          place where The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel was filmed. With a history
          dating to the early 17th century, the palace was once famed for its
          stable of fine Marwari horses and is still home to dancing stallions,
          which perform when requested in front of the magnificent turreted
          building.

          Today, you drive to the colossal hilltop fort of Chittaurgarh, the
          ancient capital of Mewar state. Thrice in its long history,
          Chittaurgarh was sacked by a stronger enemy, and on each occasion the
          men rode out to certain death, while the women committed johar by
          throwing themselves and their children onto a huge funeral pyre. The
          immense stretch of Chittaurgarh's walls and ruined palaces relate the
          saga of innumerable sieges and heroism.

          Chittaurgarh. It is home to the 200-year-old Castle Bijaipur, now
          converted into a heritage hotel. Use this destination to recharge your
          batteries by relaxing at the outdoor pool, or rent a bicycle to
          explore the region. The country roads are fairly empty apart from farm
          vehicles and many shepherds with their cattle or flocks of sheep.

          swimming pool where you can relax. If you feel more energetic, you can

          jeep, or go trekking in the surrounding hills.

          narrow valley, dominated by the awsome 14th-century Taragarh Fort, one
          of the most spectacular monuments of Rajasthan. The climb up to the
          Fort through the colourful and friendly bazaar offers spectacular
          views over the town and surrounding countryside, and takes you to the
          Chitrashala, the picture gallery with Bundi’s famous miniature
          paintings and delicate murals.

          Bundi might be small, but it’s packed with detail, just like its

          astonishing Raniji ki Baori step-well, the large and un-touristy Bundi
          Palace, which contains beautiful frescoes within its gaunt walls, and
          the huge 14th-century Taragarh or Star Fort. Bundi’s main market is
          also fascinating to walk through, with bangle sellers, flower shops
          and even sword sellers!

          cities in India, with exuberant 18th- and 19th-century palaces and
          exotic street life. Just outside town is the impressive Amber Fort. It
          is worthwhile spending time wandering through the bazaars. Jaipur is
          well known for its beautiful carpets, enameled ornaments, precious and
          semi-precious stones, brass ornaments and many other arts and crafts.

          You join local resident Payal, a keen cook and food blogger, who will
          share with you the secrets of her home cooking. She will take you to
          the food markets of Jaipur to purchase the ingredients for the dishes
          you will cook together. She will explain the preparation of
          traditional Rajasthani food, and the use of various spices. Once you
          have helped prepare the dishes, you get to enjoy them as lunch or
          dinner. With easy-to-follow menus, and after your completely hands-on

          the aristocratic families, loyal to the royal house of Jaipur,
          maintained lavish town-houses in Jaipur. Alsisar Haveli is one such
          property. The current head of the family has sympathetically restored
          the old haveli, which now has a lovely swimming pool in a large,
          peaceful garden.

          As one of the major locations used in the movie, Jaipur has plenty of
          sights and scenes you will find familiar. To explore the Pink City, it
          is best to join a guided morning walk. You will walk along the busy
          main streets, lined with parades of traditional shops, and explore
          smaller side streets, each devoted to different crafts. You will see
          various tradesmen, such as marble-sculptors and angle-makers at work,
          visit local temples, see the colourful vegetable and flower markets,
          and sample delicious street foods, such as jalebis, rabri, kachoris,
          and lassi.

          courtyard, which leads to a magnificent complex of palaces, halls,
          pavilions, gardens and temples built over 125 years. There are
          excellent views down over the old town of Amer, and up to the Jaigarh
          and Nahargarh Forts higher in the hills.

          Today, you have a long drive to Agra, but with some very interesting
          optional stops along the way, at the huge Abhaneri step-well,
          Bharatpur bird sanctuary and the grand folly of Fatehpur Sikri.
          Depending on the stops you make, the drive takes from five hours to
          most of the day.


          Agra is home to possibly the most famous and beautiful building in the
          world: the Taj Mahal, built in the 17th century by the Mughal emperor
          Shah Jahan as a tomb and memorial for his wife Mumtaz Mahal. Along the
          river Yamuna is the impressive Red Fort, the capital of the Mughal
          Empire during the 16th and 17th centuries.

          This 100-year-old building is testimony to India’s long and varied
          history. The low, white colonial building dating back to the Raj era
          is peppered with Mughal paintings and memorabilia, and was host at one
          time to the Crown Princes of England as well as to Mohammad Ali
          Jinnah. The wide lawn in the front, and the cupola-marked pool at the
          back complete the feel of a luxury heritage hotel.

          The best time of day to appreciate this stunning monument is as soon
          as the Taj Mahal opens, when it is at its quietest and most serene.
          You can enjoy the gardens, the mausoleum and the mosque. Don’t miss
          the marble inlay work and the various vantage points offered
          throughout the peaceful gardens. You can carry mobile phones, cameras,
          a water bottle and valuables inside, but all other items must be
          deposited in safety lockers at the entry gate. You are then free to
          enter the grounds of the Taj Mahal for a maximum of three hours. Once
          you have taken it all in, you can return to your hotel for a late
          breakfast.

          Itimad-ud-Daulah’s tomb - better known as the Baby Taj, which also
          features the same marble inlay work as the Taj Mahal. Finally you will
          visit Mehtab Bagh, a formally laid-out Mughal garden that offers

          Delhi is practically two cities: New Delhi, the capital of India, and
          medieval Old Delhi. The old city centres around the Red Fort, which
          contains opulent palaces and impressive public buildings. Nearby is
          the magnificent Jama Masjid, India’s largest mosque. In New Delhi you
          can find India Gate - a war memorial arch, the impressive Parliament
          Building and Rashtrapati Bhawan, the residence of the President.
          Towards the South are Qutab Minar and Humayun’s Tomb, both World
          Heritage Sites.

This quirky, cheerful movie and its sequel had everyone wondering: where on Earth is this place, exactly? Well, it's not one place, it's several - and on this tour you can visit all of them, and all while getting to know a lovely, offbeat part of India. You will get to stay at the main location at Rawla Khempur, plus smaller ones in Jaipur and Kanota, and stay at Jagat Niwas Palace in Udaipur, also featured in the movie, with views over the famous Lake Palace. As you also visit other offbeat destinations, like the wonderful Bundi and the striking Castle Bijaipur, this is a very enjoyable, different tour - even if you aren't a movie buff!
