          A two-hour flight takes you to lovely Udaipur. Set around the vast
          Pichola Lake and dominated by dramatic palaces, Udaipur is surely
          Rajasthan's most picturesque city. High whitewashed houses and narrow,
          winding alleys lend it an almost medieval charm. The huge City Palace,
          still the residence of the Maharana, is carved out of yellow sandstone
          and stands on the banks of Lake Pichola, from where you have fabulous
          views over the lake and the famous Lake Palace Hotel.

          close proximity. It is a wonderful oasis in the busy city of Udaipur.
          The rooms are tastefully furnished in traditional style. After a long
          day of sightseeing, you can relax by the pool in the garden with a few
          tortoises for company. There is a good restaurant by the pool too.

          The highlight of this guided city tour is a visit to the City Palace,
          now largely preserved as a museum with a large and varied collection
          of mosaics, glass and porcelain figures, miniatures and paintings.
          There are superb views over Lake Pichola and the Lake Palace Hotel.
          Nearby is the 17th-century Jagdish temple, famous for its superb and
          distinctive architecture and a centre of constant activity.


          The city tour is followed by a relaxing, hour-long (shared) motor boat
          ride on the lake, with views of the activity on the “ghats” used by
          local people for washing and bathing, the City Palace complex, and the
          Aravalli Hills to the west. You also pass the famous luxury Lake
          Palace hotel, and stop to visit the serene “pleasure island” of Jag
          Mandir.


          The afternoon is at leisure to just relax or explore the city on your
          own.

          A comfortable three-hour drive takes you to Deogarh, a pleasant,
          little-frequented town north of Udaipur, dominated by the huge Deogarh
          Mahal palace. The road to the palace winds its way up the top of the
          hill, through a market dotted with shops selling silver jewellery,
          clothes, fabrics, food stuffs and just about everything one needs in a
          Rajasthani household.


          The rest of the day is free for you to explore the palace.

          If you've ever wanted to play at soldiers defending a castle, this is
          the place to do it. One of Rajasthan's most spectacular palaces,
          Deogarh Mahal is a fabulous building of yellow ochre with ornate domes
          and white accents. The rooms are spread across the palace on
          different, maze-like levels. Many rooms have original furniture and
          some have exquisite frescoes and murals with mirrors. Beautiful
          handpicked fabrics enhance a feeling of quiet elegance. There is a
          well-designed swimming pool in its own secluded area.

          This little passenger train, built in the 1930s, goes at a gentle pace
          through the most beautiful forest and hills in Rajasthan, a rugged,
          cinematic landscape. On board, you get to interact with locals who are
          excited to sit next to a foreigner; the bonus is monkeys and peacocks
          on the way. The ride ends at Phulad and then you drive back to Deogarh
          along a very scenic route.


          The rest of the day is free to relax and enjoy the castle and explore
          the village.

          After breakfast, drive to Jaipur (275kms, 05:00hrs). Stay in Alsisar
          Haveli. A fairly long but not unpleasant drive (five hours) gets you
          to Jaipur, one of the most interesting cities in India, with exuberant
          18th- and 19th-century palaces and exotic street life. Just outside
          town is the impressive Amber Fort. It is worthwhile spending time
          wandering through the bazaars. Jaipur is well known for its beautiful
          carpets, enameled ornaments, precious and semi-precious stones, brass
          ornaments and many other arts and crafts.

          peace and serenity once you step through the arched gateway. Most of
          the aristocratic families, loyal to the royal house of Jaipur,
          maintained lavish town-houses in Jaipur. Alsisar Haveli is one such
          property. The current head of the family has sympathetically restored
          the old haveli, which now has a lovely swimming pool in a large,
          peaceful garden.

          experience the true Jaipur, as you cycle through the narrow alleys to
          get a peek into homes, kitchens and workshops. You learn about the
          lives of the locals and the history of the city, and visit the
          colourful and bustling vegetable and flower markets. You also enjoy a
          traditional Rajasthani breakfast in a local house.

          We wouldn't normally recommend too much sightseeing with kids, but
          Amber Fort is special. You will meet your guide directly after the
          cycling tour, who will accompany you to the fort, just to the north of
          Jaipur. There is a short, steep walk up to the entrance courtyard,
          which leads to a magnificent complex of palaces, halls, pavilions,
          gardens and temples built over 125 years. There are excellent views
          down over the old town of Amer, and up to the Jaigarh and Nahargarh
          Forts higher in the hills.


          The rest of your day is at leisure to explore Jaipur's lovely markets
          on your own.

          options along the road between the town and park entrance. The
          landscape is more open than in many other parks, making tiger

          through various gates to a plateau dotted with ruined palaces, tombs,
          and a popular Ganesh temple. There are fabulous views over the park,

          ambience, with elaborately-furnished rooms. His Highness, Krishna
          Chandra Pal, often joins guests at dinner when he is in residence.

          Fatehpur Sikri. Depending on the stops you make, the drive takes from
          three and a half to six hours.


          Agra is home to possibly the most famous and beautiful building in the
          world: the Taj Mahal, built in the 17th century by the Mughal emperor
          Shah Jahan as a tomb and memorial for his wife Mumtaz Mahal. Along the
          river Yamuna is the impressive Red Fort, the capital of the Mughal
          Empire during the 16th and 17th centuries.

          You can enjoy the gardens, the mausoleum and the mosque. Don’t miss
          the marble inlay work and the various vantage points offered
          throughout the peaceful gardens. You can carry mobile phones, cameras,
          a water bottle and valuables inside, but all other items must be
          deposited in safety lockers at the entry gate. You are then free to
          enter the grounds of the Taj Mahal for a maximum of three hours. Once
          you have taken it all in, you can return to your hotel for a late
          breakfast.

          Delhi is practically two cities: New Delhi, the capital of India, and
          medieval Old Delhi. The old city centres around the Red Fort, which
          contains opulent palaces and impressive public buildings. Nearby is
          the magnificent Jama Masjid, India’s largest mosque. In New Delhi you
          can find India Gate - a war memorial arch, the impressive Parliament
          Building and Rashtrapati Bhawan, the residence of the President.
          Towards the South are Qutab Minar and Humayun’s Tomb, both World

          New Delhi has a number of attractions, like Humayun’s Tomb, a
          sandstone mausoleum in the authentic Mughal style - the Taj Mahal,
          built much later, follows a similar style of architecture. Nearby you
          can see India Gate, the Parliament Buildings, the Lodhi Gardens, the
          Lotus Temple, the President’s House, and the Sikh temple, Gurudwara
          Bangla Sahib. However, Delhi is huge and traffic is usually heavy, and
          half a day is not enough to see all of the attractions, so it is best
          to discuss with your guide which sights you might wish to visit.


          The afternoon is free for you to relax or explore further on your own.
          If you'd like to go shopping, Connaught Place is a good place to
          explore.
