Day 1, Delhi
You start your tour on arrival in Delhi, where you will be met by our representative and transferred to your airport hotel, convenient for driving straight to Mandawa the next day.

Suggested hotel: HOLIDAY INN (AEROCITY)
For a comfortable stay before for after a long flight, the Holiday Inn at Aerocity, close to Delhi's International Airport, is ideal. The rooms are large, modern, and, most important of all, quiet. There is a swimming pool, a large restaurant with abundant buffets, a bar, and a speciality Italian restaurant. 



Day 2, Mandawa
Today, you have a long drive (about 7 hours), but one on which you see India unfold from urban roads to highways to smaller towns and finally Rajasthan's villages. You end up at Mandawa, a small town in the heart of Rajasthan's Shekhavati area, famous for its painted havelis (mansions). These havelis were built in the 19th century by Marwari merchants who decorated them lavishly with frescoes, turning them into status symbols and homes for their extended families, providing security and comfort in style.

Suggested hotel: DESERT RESORT
Located on the outskirts of Mandawa and overlooking fields and sand dunes, the unique and atmospheric Desert Resort is a truly original place to stay. It's a purpose-built village, with streets leading to clusters of huts and thatched pavilions from which to enjoy the surroundings. The delightful "mud huts" are surprisingly comfortable, with large modern bathrooms, and are brightly decorated with local textiles and craftwork. There is an azure swimming pool, and elaborate buffet meals are served in the cool dining room, which is decorated with shells.


Day 3, Mandawa

MORNING WALKING TOUR OF MANDAWA
Starting at the impressive Mandawa Castle, our guide takes you on a stroll around the sandy lanes of this small town. Here you will see several of the "painted havelis" for which the region of Shekhawati is known. Built by wealthy Marwari merchants, some of these large family houses are now semi-abandoned, others slowly being restored. The paintings depict not only religious scenes, but also many different aspects of daily life, including several which display the influence of Europeans. Often referred to as an "open-air art gallery", the havelis, and other typical architectural features such as wells and memorials, are unique to this area.

AFTERNOON CAMEL RIDE TO VILLAGES NEAR MANDAWA
An afternoon camel ride to nearby villages is a good way to get to know the Shekhawati desert. It is a short but scenic ride and the local people are genuinely pleased to see you. It is surprising how well populated the desert is, and there is an ever-changing panorama of farmland, wells, and villages to be seen amongst the desert scrub from your lofty perch on the camel.


Day 4, Bikaner
Driving for about 4 hours through the expanse of the Thar desert gets you to Bikaner, which grew around the fabulous Junagarh Fort. The fort is a large 5-storey structure, the surrounding wall of which is more than a kilometre in length! Its sumptuously decorated interiors are much better preserved than any other fort in Rajasthan. The old city retains a medieval air with its maze of narrow lanes and some beautifully-carved havelis in red sandstone, and many palaces and mansions survive outside the walls.

AFTERNOON GUIDED TOUR OF BIKANER
Founded in the 16th century and expanded by later rulers, the huge Junagarh Fort contains many stone-carved palace buildings filled with memorabilia of Rajput palace life. The different architectural styles within are also impressive. You will also visit the colourful market area, with its old havelis (merchant houses) and Jain temples.

Suggested hotel: BHANWAR NIWAS
A lovely pink sandstone haveli in the narrow winding streets of old Bikaner. Built in the early 20th century, the building is a fascinating combination of Indian and European styles with just a few large, richly furnished rooms, giving it a hushed, private feel. There are grand ceilings, stencils and friezes; the Blue Drawing room is in pale blue and gold leaf, the Grand Staircase in a riot of gold - you will be dazzled! 

 

Day 5, Jaisalmer
The heart of the Thar desert, Jaisalmer, is a six-hour drive from Bikaner. The massive, turreted Golden Fort dominates Jaisalmer's skyline and the vast surrounding desert. Founded in the 12th 
century, the fort stands on a high hill, enclosed by a thick wall and reinforced with bastions. Within these bastions is a complete township of cobbled streets strewn with palaces, mansions of rich merchants, and temples. 

Suggested hotel: NACHANA HAVELI
A 300-year-old sandstone mansion in the old part of Jaisalmer, Nachana Haveli has a lovely secluded courtyard with narrow corridors leading to rooms scattered throughout the building. The rooms vary in size but they are all full of character, furnished with lovely carved furniture and old paintings and relics. The rooftop Saffron restaurant has fine views of Jaisalmer Fort and is a popular gathering place in the evenings.



Day 6, Jaisalmer

MORNING WALKING TOUR OF JAISALMER
Walking through Jaisalmer's narrow, cobbled lanes provides visitors with an extraordinarily medieval feel, unique in modern India. The fort itself is not simply a monument, but is home to several thousand people. Within it you can see attractive Jain temples and fascinating architecture, and enjoy superb views over the city and the desert from many vantage points. Hidden among the narrow lanes leading off the main market street are several magnificent havelis. Patwon Ki Haveli is best known for its latticed facade, and Nathmal Haveli has now been converted into a small museum of local artefacts. The Gadi Sagar lake is also worth seeing for its historic pavilions.
	
OVERNIGHT CAMEL SAFARI IN THE THAR DESERT
The best way to experience the Thar Desert that surrounds Jaisalmer is on an overnight camel safari. Leaving Jaisalmer in the mid-afternoon, you enjoy a half-hour jeep ride, and then board camels for a ride lasting approximately two hours through a peaceful, unspoilt area of the desert, passing through a mix of scrub, bushes, and sand dunes.  

The camp is set up in a peaceful location close to sand dunes. The tents are simple, but all bedding is supplied, and hot water is provided for washing. The camp staff prepares dinner and breakfast, and the highlight is spending the evening under a blanket of stars.


	
Day 7, Jaisalmer
This morning, after a steaming breakfast amid the dunes, there is a second camel ride on a different route for around an hour before taking the jeep back to Jaisalmer. You arrive in the mid-morning back at your original hotel, where your luggage has been stored. The rest of the day is at leisure to explore this fascinating town on your own.	



Day 8, Jodhpur
You travel back out to the edge of the desert to Jodhpur, about a five-hour drive. Jodhpur is dominated by the massive Meherangarh Fort, which houses an excellent museum and affords captivating views of the blue Brahmin houses of the old city. The clock tower is a popular landmark in the old city. Narrow alleys lead from here to bazaars for textiles, silver and handicrafts. It's a fascinating jumble of winding streets, of great interest to wander around in the evening.

Suggested hotel: PAL HAVELI
A unique hotel in the heart of the old city of Jodhpur, with superb views over the city. Located close to the bottom of the majestic Meherangarh Fort, Pal Haveli is possibly the best place from which to admire the scope of this architectural feat. The haveli is a maze of courtyards, stone stairways, terraces and excellent carvings. The spacious guest rooms are delightfully furnished in the typical Rajasthani aristocratic style.



Day 9, Jodhpur

MORNING AUDIO-GUIDE TOUR OF JODHPUR'S MEHERANGARH FORT
Perched on a hilltop dominating the city, Meherangarh Fort is the most visually spectacular in Rajasthan. It is approached by a series of seven gateways set at an angle to hinder invading armies. Past the gates, the fort-palace has huge courtyards surrounded by wings of palatial buildings, part of which is now turned into a fabulous museum. An excellent audio tour is included in the entrance fee, and this leads you through the museum within the Fort. 
 
Afterwards, it is well worth exploring the ramparts of the fort, with their superb views. The Jaswant Thada memorial lies on the approach to the Fort, and the large white marble structure is surrounded by the cremation grounds of former rulers.


	
Day 10, Padarla
Padarla is a small village in the Jawai Leopard Conservation Zone around the Bera area in Rajasthan, a three-hour drive from Jodhpur. This area is a thriving hub of leopards: this place is blessed with natural rocky hill outcrops which is ideal leopard habitat. In this dairy farming region. the abundance of cattle and monkeys provides a leopard various food options. The region boasts of many other species of animals and birds, from owls to crocodiles. 

AFTERNOON WILDLIFE SAFARI
A naturalist will be your guide for a leopard safari in the Jawai Conservation Zone. Leopards are solitary, elusive creatures, but this rocky landscape is the perfect place to look for them. The safari (with up to 5 people to a jeep) includes a high-tea break and plenty of time to look for the cats.

Suggested hotel: GODWAD LEOPARD SAFARI CAMP

Day 11, Udaipur
This morning, you drive through the hills of southern Rajasthan, visiting the beautiful complex of marble temples at Ranakpur, en route to Udaipur.

UDAIPUR
You end the day in lovely Udaipur. Set around the vast Pichola Lake and dominated by dramatic palaces, Udaipur is surely Rajasthan's most picturesque city. High whitewashed houses and narrow, winding alleys lend it an almost medieval charm. The huge City Palace, still the residence of the Maharana, is carved out of yellow sandstone and stands on the banks of Lake Pichola, from where you 
have fabulous views over the lake and the famous Lake Palace Hotel.

Suggested hotel: MAHENDRA PRAKASH
Mahendra Prakash is a haveli-style hotel in a quiet location on a shaded avenue near the Rose Garden, with the main city sights still in close proximity.

Day 12, Udaipur
MORNING CITY TOUR OF UDAIPUR, FOLLOWED BY A BOAT TRIP ON LAKE PICHOLA (BY SHARED BOAT)

There are superb views over Lake Pichola and the Lake Palace Hotel. Nearby is the 17th-century Jagdish temple, famous for its superb and distinctive architecture and a centre of constant activity. 

The city tour is followed by a relaxing, hour-long (shared) motor boat ride on the lake, with views of the activity on the "ghats" used by local people for washing and bathing, the City Palace complex, and the Aravalli Hills to the west. You also pass the famous luxury Lake Palace hotel, and stop to visit the serene "pleasure island" of Jag Mandir.

Finally, you get to enjoy the food which you have prepared, along with the family.


Day 13, Chittaurgarh
After breakfast, you drive about three hours to the colossal hilltop fort of Chittaurgarh, the ancient capital of Mewar state. Thrice in its long history, Chittaurgarh was sacked by a stronger enemy, and on each occasion the men rode out to certain death, while the women committed johar by throwing themselves and their children onto a huge funeral pyre. The immense stretch of Chittaurgarh's walls and ruined palaces relate the saga of innumerable sieges and heroism.

AFTERNOON VISIT TO CHITTAURGARH FORT
The fort at Chittaurgarh is the greatest in Rajasthan. The 700-acre complex standing on a rocky mountain plateau feels like the ultimate spot for a History Channel re-enactment. But there are no fallen actors here, just a series of stunning palaces, gates, temples and the startling Jaya Stambha.

Suggested hotel: THE PADMINI HAVELI GUESTHOME
This delightful family-run homestay occupies an old haveli in a village within the walls of Chittaurgarh Fort.

AFTERNOON GUIDED TOUR OF BUNDI
Bundi might be small, but it's packed with detail, just like its famous miniature paintings. The guided tour takes you to the astonishing Raniji ki Baori step-well, the large and un-touristy Bundi Palace, which contains beautiful frescoes within its gaunt walls, and the huge 14th-century Taragarh or Star Fort. Bundi's main market is also fascinating to walk through, with bangle sellers, flower shops and even sword sellers!

Suggested hotel: HOTEL BUNDI HAVELI
An old haveli turned into a small, chic guesthouse. Immaculate and gleaming in white, the haveli is built around a minuscule courtyard. Scalloped arches encircle the verandah restaurant and white walls set off a well-chosen collection of artefacts. The 10 tastefully furnished rooms are on the upper floors.
