Day 1, Delhi
You start your tour on arrival in Delhi, where you will be met by our representative and transferred to your hotel.

Delhi is practically two cities: New Delhi, the capital of India, and medieval Old Delhi. The old city centres around the Red Fort, which contains opulent palaces and impressive public buildings. Nearby is the magnificent Jama Masjid, India’s largest mosque. In New Delhi you can find India Gate - a war memorial arch, the impressive Parliament Building and Rashtrapati Bhawan, the residence of the President. Towards the South are Qutab Minar and Humayun's Tomb, both World Heritage Sites.

Suggested hotel: THE IMPERIAL HOTEL
A delightful colonial hotel right in the centre of New Delhi. Set in tree-lined gardens with a swimming pool, the Imperial has an air of serenity and old-world opulence. The high-ceilinged rooms are furnished with classic pieces, with the flooring in wood and marble. A museum-quality collection of Raj-era art lines the corridors. In addition, The Imperial offers five excellent restaurants, and a large, historic bar.



Day 2, Delhi

HALF DAY TOUR OF NEW DELHI
New Delhi has a number of attractions, like Humayun's Tomb, a sandstone mausoleum in the authentic Mughal style - the Taj Mahal, built much later, follows a similar style of architecture. Nearby you can see India Gate, the Parliament Buildings, the Lodhi Gardens, the Lotus Temple, the President's House, and the Sikh temple, Gurudwara Bangla Sahib. However, Delhi is huge and traffic is usually heavy, and half a day is not enough to see all of the attractions, so it is best to discuss with your guide which sights you might wish to visit.

The afternoon is free for you to relax or explore further on your own.



Day 3, Samode
After breakfast, a five-hour drive takes you to the fairytale palace of Samode, nestled among rugged hills, and the narrow cobbled streets of the village it overlooks. This superbly restored 18th-century palace was put on the map by its starring role in the 1984 mini-series `The Far Pavilions'. Coming from Jaipur, Samode is the gateway to the famous Shekhawati region. The palace itself has several frescoes - original and also restored, in many of its public areas.

The day is free for you to enjoy the palace.

Suggested hotel: SAMODE PALACE
The palace has public areas of immense beauty such as the Sultan Mahal, the Sheesh Mahal and, grandest of all, the Durbar Hall, with the finest of Shekhavati-style frescoes. The rooms have old-world charm replete with antique furniture, and fabulous modern bathrooms. There are two delightful swimming pools, and several atmospheric dining areas.



Day 4, Samode

DAY AT LEISURE IN SAMODE
Today, you have the terrible burden of exploring and enjoying the palace, trying to decide which swimming pool to laze by, which restaurant to eat in, and what spa treatment to endure. We hope it isn't too strenuous to bear! 

Alternatively, you can also explore the quaint village on foot or camel back or enjoy a picnic lunch in the mango orchard of nearby Samode Bagh, the old royal hunting lodge, which has beautiful gardens. For those with energy to burn, you can climb the 376 steps beside the Palace to the Samode Fort that once protected the kingdom. The climb is steep but the views across the valley make it worth the effort. 


Day 5, Jaipur
Just an hour away is Jaipur, one of the most interesting cities in India, with exuberant 18th- and 19th-century palaces and exotic street life. Just outside town is the impressive Amber Fort. It is worthwhile spending time wandering through the bazaars. Jaipur is well known for its beautiful carpets, enameled ornaments, precious and semi-precious stones, brass ornaments and many other arts and crafts.

The rest of the day is at leisure to enjoy the hotel, or to explore Jaipur on your own.

Suggested hotel: SAMODE HAVELI
A lovely old haveli set around a pleasant courtyard, just inside the Old City walls, built as a townhouse for the royal family of Samode. The rooms in the rambling building are well furnished with local hand-block printed fabrics and period furniture. The restaurant is decorated with exquisite frescoes. The pool area, with a bar and spa, is a very welcome area for relaxation. A genteel, luxurious option in Jaipur.



Day 6, Jaipur
MORNING WALKING TOUR OF THE PINK CITY
To experience the life of the Pink City beyond the monuments, it is best to join a guided morning walk. Starting in the heart of the Old City, you will walk along the busy main streets, lined with parades of traditional shops, and explore smaller side streets, each devoted to different crafts. You will see various tradesmen, such as marble-sculptors and bangle-makers at work, visit local temples, see the colourful vegetable and flower markets, and sample delicious street foods, such as jalebis, rabri, kachoris, and lassi.

AFTERNOON GUIDED TOUR OF AMBER FORT
Just to the north of Jaipur, Amber Fort overlooks the city from a spur of the Aravalli Hills. There is a short, steep walk up to the entrance courtyard, which leads to a magnificent complex of palaces, halls, pavilions, gardens and temples built over 125 years. There are excellent views down over the old town of Amer, and up to the Jaigarh and Nahargarh Forts higher in the hills.



Day 7, Raipur 
Leave Jaipur this morning for a four-hour drive into the countryside to Raipur, on the banks of the Luni River, and a good place to get to know rural India.

Suggested hotel: LAKSHMAN SAGAR
A unique place, stunningly located by a lake in the Aravalli hills, Lakshman Sagar offers supreme comfort in natural surroundings. Designed to blend into the rocky terrain, there are 12 tasteful villas, set well apart, with plunge pools and spectacular views. The rock swimming pool is a major attraction, and there are many nooks and crannies. There's plenty of wildlife here, and nature walks and bicycles are on offer, all of which you can book directly at the hotel.



Day 8, Raipur

DAY AT LEISURE AT LAKSHMAN SAGAR
Lakshman Sagar is a perfect place to simply relax in tranquil surroundings, enjoy the rock-cut pool, and watch the sunset by the dam. But, you can also enjoy locally arranged customized experiences such as local liquor tasting, goat herding, nature walks, horse riding and star gazing.



Day 9, Jodhpur
You travel to Jodhpur at the edge of the Thar desert, about a four-hour drive. Jodhpur is dominated by the massive Meherangarh Fort, which houses an excellent museum and affords captivating views of the blue Brahmin houses of the old city. The clock tower is a popular landmark in the old city. Narrow alleys lead from here to bazaars for textiles, silver and handicrafts. It's a fascinating jumble of winding streets, of great interest to wander around in the evening.

Suggested hotel: RAAS JODHPUR
Jodhpur's most innovative boutique hotel, stunningly situated at the foot of the mighty Meherangarh Fort, in the heart of the Old City. This luxurious hotel has a gorgeous swimming pool, a lovely spa, an atmospheric dining room, a cool cafe, and pretty terraces. Almost all the rooms and suites have fort views. They are highly sophisticated in their amenities and the decor is chic, contemporary and understated.



Day 10, Jodhpur

MORNING AUDIO-GUIDE TOUR OF JODHPUR'S MEHERANGARH FORT
Perched on a hilltop dominating the city, Meherangarh Fort is the most visually spectacular in Rajasthan. It is approached by a series of seven gateways set at an angle to hinder invading armies. Past the gates, the fort-palace has huge courtyards surrounded by wings of palatial buildings, part of which is now turned into a fabulous museum. An excellent audio tour is included in the entrance fee, and this leads you through the museum within the Fort. 
 
Afterwards, it is well worth exploring the ramparts of the fort, with their superb views. The Jaswant Thada memorial lies on the approach to the Fort, and the large white marble structure is surrounded by the cremation grounds of former rulers.


The afternoon is at leisure to further explore Jodhpur on your own.



Day 11, Chanoud
A three-hour drive away, Chanoud is almost mid-way Jodhpur and Udaipur. This off the beaten track village houses a 300-year-old fort, now converted into a small luxury heritage hotel. The    13th-generation royal descendants who host your stay arrange the most authentic encounters with local villagers and excursions to the bird-rich saltpans in the nearby Aravalli foothills.
	
AFTERNOON JEEP SAFARI
Head out for an invigorating drive into the countryside and experience the breath-taking view of the salt pans under the desert sun. The site is also the habitat for several migratory birds and an ideal spot for birding. The drive also offers a glimpse into the Rabari settlements. The safari is also an ideal picnic spot with tea and snacks served at the site at sunset.

Suggested stay: HOTEL CHANOUD GARH
This recently-restored palace offers a heritage homestay experience. The personable young owners will oversee every moment of your stay. They will show you round the property, including the museum-like Hall, and escort you to your sumptuous room. All meals are included, and are served in different atmospheric "dining locations". 
	


Day 12, Chanoud

MORNING VILLAGE WALK
Every morning, after breakfast, a retired local schoolteacher takes guests on a hugely enjoyable village walk. You will visit the local temple, see a step-well, and will witness local tradesmen, such as cobblers and tailors, at work. As you stroll around, the friendly local villagers will be happy to be photographed and to exchange a few words of greeting.

EVENING COOKING CLASS
This fun cooking class, led by the lady of the house, guides you through a 4-5 course Rajasthani menu, including dessert. Conducted in a separate kitchen/dining area, the 2-3 hour class class is interactive, and takes you through the whole cooking process. Tea and drinks are served during the class, and you get to enjoy the dinner afterwards. You will also be given prints of the family recipes, and small souvenirs. 



Day 13, Udaipur
This morning, you drive through the hills of southern Rajasthan, visiting the beautiful complex of marble temples at Ranakpur, en route to Udaipur.

UDAIPUR
You end the day in lovely Udaipur. Set around the vast Pichola Lake and dominated by dramatic palaces, Udaipur is surely Rajasthan's most picturesque city. High whitewashed houses and narrow, winding alleys lend it an almost medieval charm. The huge City Palace, still the residence of the Maharana, is carved out of yellow sandstone and stands on the banks of Lake Pichola, from where you 
have fabulous views over the lake and the famous Lake Palace Hotel.


Suggested hotel: TAJ FATEH PRAKASH PALACE
Among the heritage hotels, the highest category is Grand Heritage - denoting an especially opulent palace. Fateh Prakash is justifiably in this category. Now managed by the Taj group, the hotel consists of a handful of rooms that are part of the City Palace and a new wing of excellent rooms by the lake. Most rooms enjoy fabulous views over Lake Pichola and the Lake Palace, and feature authentic period furniture.


Day 14, Udaipur

MORNING CITY TOUR OF UDAIPUR, FOLLOWED BY A BOAT TRIP ON LAKE PICHOLA (BY SHARED BOAT)
The highlight of this guided city tour is a visit to the City Palace, now largely preserved as a museum with a large and varied collection of mosaics, glass and porcelain figures, miniatures and paintings. There are superb views over Lake Pichola and the Lake Palace Hotel. Nearby is the 17th-century Jagdish temple, famous for its superb and distinctive architecture and a centre of constant activity. 

The city tour is followed by a relaxing, hour-long (shared) motor boat ride on the lake, with views of the activity on the "ghats" used by local people for washing and bathing, the City Palace complex, and the Aravalli Hills to the west. You also pass the famous luxury Lake Palace hotel, and stop to visit the serene "pleasure island" of Jag Mandir.


Day 15, Udaipur
Today, you have a departure transfer in Udaipur to the airport, to connect with your onward flight.
