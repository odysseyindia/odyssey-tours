description: "This quirky, cheerful movie and its sequel had everyone wondering: where on Earth is this place, exactly? Well, it's not one place, it's several - and on this tour you can visit all of them, and all while getting to know a lovely, offbeat part of India. You will get to stay at the main location at Rawla Khempur, plus smaller ones in Jaipur and Kanota, and stay at Jagat Niwas Palace in Udaipur, also featured in the movie, with views over the famous Lake Palace. As you also visit other offbeat destinations, like the wonderful Bundi and the striking Castle Bijaipur, this is a very enjoyable, different tour - even if you aren't a movie buff!"

Day 1, Delhi
Today, you start your tour on arrival in Delhi, where you will be met by our representative and transferred to your airport hotel, convenient for flying straight to Udaipur the next day.

Suggested hotel: HOLIDAY INN (AEROCITY)
For a comfortable stay before or after a long flight, the Holiday Inn at Aerocity, close to Delhi's International Airport, is ideal. The rooms are large, modern, and, most important of all, quiet. There is a swimming pool, a large restaurant with abundant buffets, a bar, and a speciality Italian restaurant.

 
Day 2, Udaipur
A two-hour flight takes you to lovely Udaipur. Set around the vast Pichola Lake and dominated by dramatic palaces, Udaipur is surely Rajasthan's most picturesque city. High whitewashed houses and narrow, winding alleys lend it an almost medieval charm. The huge City Palace, still the residence of the Maharana, is carved out of yellow sandstone and stands on the banks of Lake Pichola, from where you have fabulous views over the lake and the famous Lake Palace Hotel.

Suggested hotel: JAGAT NIWAS PALACE HOTEL
A delightful 17th-century haveli, right on the banks of Lake Pichola. The whitewashed walls and plants create an atmosphere of pure relaxation and tranquility in this otherwise busy area. The rooms differ in size and decor, but are all attractive, with local fabrics and antique furniture. Most do not have lake views, but the many terraces, the rooftop pool and the restaurant all have excellent views of Lake Pichola.



Day 3, Udaipur

MORNING CITY TOUR OF UDAIPUR, FOLLOWED BY A BOAT TRIP ON LAKE PICHOLA (BY SHARED BOAT)
The highlight of this guided city tour is a visit to the City Palace, now largely preserved as a museum with a large and varied collection of mosaics, glass and porcelain figures, miniatures and paintings. There are superb views over Lake Pichola and the Lake Palace Hotel. Nearby is the 17th-century Jagdish temple, famous for its superb and distinctive architecture and a centre of constant activity. 

The city tour is followed by a relaxing, hour-long (shared) motor boat ride on the lake, with views of the activity on the "ghats" used by local people for washing and bathing, the City Palace complex, and the Aravalli Hills to the west. You also pass the famous luxury Lake Palace hotel, and stop to visit the serene "pleasure island" of Jag Mandir.

Your afternoon is at leisure. We recommend a gin & tonic on the terrace overlooking the lake in Udaipur!



Day 4, Khempur
An hour's drive east of Udaipur is the little village of Khempur, set amid mustard and millet fields. At the edge of the village is Ravla Khempur, now a heritage hotel, famous in film as the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel. Khempur is also famous for its beautiful Marwari horses. A stay here therefore offers the opportunity to explore the Indian countryside on horseback.

RAVLA KHEMPUR
Ravla Khempur is a grand, two-storey haveli, pale yellow in colour, with arched windows trimmed with ornate white carvings. With a history dating to the early 17th century, the palace was once famed for its stable of fine Marwari horses and is still home to dancing stallions, which perform when requested in front of the magnificent turreted building. A large neem tree shades the family temple next to the fort.



Day 5, Khempur

DAY AT LEISURE IN KHEMPUR
Today is a free day to enjoy all that this Real Exotic Marigold Hotel has to offer. You may wish to take a walk around the quiet and picturesque village or visit a local school. Alternative, you may choose to simply relax in this wonderfully quirky property that takes you into the world portrayed in the film.
	


Day 6, Bijaipur
Today, you drive to the colossal hilltop fort of Chittaurgarh, the ancient capital of Mewar state. Thrice in its long history, Chittaurgarh was sacked by a stronger enemy, and on each occasion the men rode out to certain death, while the women committed johar by throwing themselves and their children onto a huge funeral pyre. The immense stretch of Chittaurgarh's walls and ruined palaces relate the saga of innumerable sieges and heroism.

BIJAIPUR
Afterwards, you continue to Bijaipur, a quaint village 40km from Chittaurgarh. It is home to the 200-year-old Castle Bijaipur, now converted into a heritage hotel. Use this destination to recharge your batteries by relaxing at the outdoor pool, or rent a bicycle to explore the region. The country roads are fairly empty apart from farm vehicles and many shepherds with their cattle or flocks of sheep.
	
Suggested hotel: CASTLE BIJAIPUR
Castle Bijaipur is a 16th-century castle with attractive domes and arched windows and doorways. The castle offers rooms of varying sizes and decor, simply furnished using local materials. There is a lovely swimming pool where you can relax. If you feel more energetic, you can explore the village, lakeside and nearby forts by cycle, horse or jeep, or go trekking in the surrounding hills.
	


Day 7, Bijaipur

ACTIVITIES AT CASTLE BIJAIPUR
Today is a free day for you to select the activity you'd like to. Castle Bijaipur has a number of excursions available, most of which are perfect if you like a little adventure; these include a jeep safari, horse riding, cycling, trekking, bird watching and village walks. They will also put on cooking demos, organise yoga classes, and give you the chance to visit a local Gujjar family. All these activities can be booked directly at the hotel.
	


Day 8, Bundi
Bundi, a three-hour drive from Bijaipur, is situated in a beautiful narrow valley, dominated by the awsome 14th-century Taragarh Fort, one of the most spectacular monuments of Rajasthan. The climb up to the Fort through the colourful and friendly bazaar offers spectacular views over the town and surrounding countryside, and takes you to the Chitrashala, the picture gallery with Bundi's famous miniature paintings and delicate murals.

AFTERNOON GUIDED TOUR OF BUNDI
Bundi might be small, but it's packed with detail, just like its famous miniature paintings. The guided tour takes you to the astonishing Raniji ki Baori step-well, the large and un-touristy Bundi Palace, which contains beautiful frescoes within its gaunt walls, and the huge 14th-century Taragarh or Star Fort. Bundi's main market is also fascinating to walk through, with bangle sellers, flower shops and even sword sellers!

Suggested hotel: HOTEL BUNDI HAVELI
An old haveli turned into a small, chic guesthouse. Immaculate and gleaming in white, the haveli is built around a minuscule courtyard. Scalloped arches encircle the verandah restaurant and white walls set off a well-chosen collection of artefacts. The 10 tastefully furnished rooms are on the upper floors. The rooftop offers great views of the Palace complex, the hilltop Taragarh Fort beyond, especially at sunset. 
	




Day 9, Jaipur
A four-hour drive takes you to Jaipur, one of the most interesting cities in India, with exuberant 18th- and 19th-century palaces and exotic street life. Just outside town is the impressive Amber Fort. It is worthwhile spending time wandering through the bazaars. Jaipur is well known for its beautiful carpets, enameled ornaments, precious and semi-precious stones, brass ornaments and many other 
arts and crafts.

EVENING CULINARY TOUR WITH AN INDIAN HOUSEWIFE, WITH DINNER
You join local resident Payal, a keen cook and food blogger, who will share with you the secrets of her home cooking. She will take you to the food markets of Jaipur to purchase the ingredients for the dishes you will cook together. She will explain the preparation of traditional Rajasthani food, and the use of various spices. Once you have helped prepare the dishes, you get to enjoy them for dinner. With easy-to-follow menus, and after your completely hands-on experience, you will be eager to demonstrate your new skills back home!

Suggested hotel: ALSISAR HAVELI
Just off a busy street near the old walled city, Alsisar Haveli offers peace and serenity once you step through the arched gateway. Most of the aristocratic families, loyal to the royal house of Jaipur, maintained lavish town-houses in Jaipur. Alsisar Haveli is one such property. The current head of the family has sympathetically restored the old haveli, which now has a lovely swimming pool in a large, peaceful garden.
	


Day 10, Jaipur

MORNING WALKING TOUR OF THE PINK CITY
As one of the major locations used in the movie, Jaipur has plenty of sights and scenes you will 
find familiar. To explore the Pink City, it is best to join a guided morning walk. You will walk along the busy main streets, lined with parades of traditional shops, and explore smaller side streets, each devoted to different crafts. You will see various tradesmen, such as marble-sculptors and angle-makers at work, visit local temples, see the colourful vegetable and flower markets, and sample delicious street foods, such as jalebis, rabri, kachoris, and lassi.


AFTERNOON GUIDED TOUR OF AMBER FORT
Just to the north of Jaipur, Amber Fort overlooks the city from a spur of the Aravalli Hills. There is a short, steep walk up to the entrance courtyard, which leads to a magnificent complex of palaces, halls, pavilions, gardens and temples built over 125 years. There are excellent views down over the old town of Amer, and up to the Jaigarh and Nahargarh Forts higher in the hills.



Day 11, Jaipur
Today is at leisure with the chance to ride auto rickshaws and cycle rickshaws through Jaipur. 

You spend the evening at Castle Kanota, the filming location for the exclusive 'Viceroy's Club' featured in both movies.


	


Day 12, Agra
Today, you have a long drive to Agra, but with some very interesting optional stops along the way, at the huge Abhaneri step-well, Bharatpur bird sanctuary and the grand folly of Fatehpur Sikri. Depending on the stops you make, the drive takes from five hours to most of the day.
 
AGRA
Agra is home to possibly the most famous and beautiful building in the world: the Taj Mahal, built in the 17th century by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan as a tomb and memorial for his wife Mumtaz Mahal. Along the river Yamuna is the impressive Red Fort, the capital of the Mughal Empire during the 16th and 17th centuries.

Suggested hotel: THE GRAND IMPERIAL
This 100-year-old building is testimony to India's long and varied history. The low, white colonial building dating back to the Raj era is peppered with Mughal paintings and memorabilia, and was host at one time to the Crown Princes of England as well as to Mohammad Ali Jinnah. The wide lawn in the front, and the cupola-marked pool at the back complete the feel of a luxury heritage hotel.	


Day 13, Agra
EARLY MORNING VISIT ON YOUR OWN TO THE TAJ MAHAL 
The best time of day to appreciate this stunning monument is as soon as the Taj Mahal opens, when it is at its quietest and most serene. You can enjoy the gardens, the mausoleum and the mosque, without needing a professional guide. Don't miss the marble inlay work and the various vantage points offered throughout the peaceful gardens. Once you have taken it all in, you can return to your hotel for a late breakfast.

AFTERNOON GUIDED TOUR OF AGRA'S OTHER MONUMENTS
Agra has much to offer besides the Taj Mahal, such as Agra Fort, a masterpiece of design and construction. You then visit Itimad-ud-Daulah's tomb - better known as the Baby Taj, which also features the same marble inlay work as the Taj Mahal. Finally you will visit Mehtab Bagh, a formally laid-out Mughal garden that offers stupendous views of the Taj Mahal, especially in the late afternoon. 



Day 14, Delhi
	
Today, you drive back to Delhi along the Yamuna Expressway, which should take about 4 hours. The rest of your day is at leisure, to either rest or to explore on your own.

Delhi is practically two cities: New Delhi, the capital of India, and medieval Old Delhi. The old city centres around the Red Fort, which contains opulent palaces and impressive public buildings. Nearby is the magnificent Jama Masjid, India’s largest mosque. In New Delhi you can find India Gate - a war memorial arch, the impressive Parliament Building and Rashtrapati Bhawan, the residence of the President. Towards the South are Qutab Minar and Humayun's Tomb, both World Heritage Sites.


Suggested hotel: THE CLARIDGES
A colonial building in a peaceful garden setting in the centre of Lutyens’ New Delhi. The lobby is light and airy whilst the air-conditioned rooms are spacious with all modern conveniences. There is a large swimming pool, a health club and a tennis court, and multiple, excellent restaurants. A pleasant superior hotel with old-world charm and a lovely location.
	


Day 15, Delhi
Today, a departure transfer will take you to Delhi airport to catch your onward flight.
