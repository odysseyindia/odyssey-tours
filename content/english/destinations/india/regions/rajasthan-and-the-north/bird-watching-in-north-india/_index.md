          Your morning is at leisure to recover from your jet-lag. In the
          afternoon, you take an express train to Bharatpur, famous for its bird
          sanctuary, Keoladeo Ghana National Park. A network of paths, trails
          and lagoons, this is home to hundreds of species of birds. In winter,
          the resident population of birds is enhanced by many species of
          migratory birds. Bharatpur is a beautiful, peaceful place, enjoyable
          even for non-birders, as motorised vehicles are not allowed, and it
          can be explored on foot, bicycle or cycle rickshaw.

          Keoladeo Ghana is one of the world’s finest bird sanctuaries. The best
          time to visit is in the early mornings and late afternoons, when the
          birds are most active. The best way to tour the park is by cycle
          rickshaw, as the drivers are all trained birding guides; you can also
          walk on the smaller trails. When there is enough water, you can also
          take a row-boat ride, to get close to the aquatic birds and their
          nesting colonies.

          Today, your first stop is the deserted Mughal city of Fatehpur Sikri,
          a complex of sandstone forts, palaces and mosques. Fatehpur Sikri was
          Emperor Akbar’s capital for only 12 years before it was abandoned,
          apparently due to a lack of water. Today it is a ghost city, its
          architecture perfectly preserved. The white marble tomb of Sheikh
          Salim Chisti, Akbar’s spiritual adviser, is a Muslim pilgrimage spot.


          You continue to the village of Bah, near the ravines of the Chambal
          River, once known for gangs of bandits, but now for wonderful
          wildlife. Along the river, you will find the endangered gharial
          crocodile and Ganges dolphins, the mugger crocodile, turtles, and a
          huge array of bird species. The Bateshwar temples, scene of a large
          biennial fair in October-November, are also worth a visit for their
          location on the riverbank.

          Set against a stunning backdrop, framed by the ravines and sandbanks,
          the calm waters of the Chambal River are best explored on boats. The
          gentle pace of the river safari is designed to provide spectacular
          sightings of the gharials, muggers & turtles basking in the sun, the
          many migratory and resident birds flying sorties, and the occasional
          glimpses of the Gangetic river dolphins breaking surface.

          Mela Kothi was once a ‘camp office’ for the aristocratic family of
          nearby Jarar, used when they organised the Bateshwar fair. It is now a
          comfortable eco-lodge run by the family, who are also
          conservationists, and this is a fabulous place for birders in
          particular. The suites and cottages are spread out under ancient
          trees, separated by pleasant lawns and tree-canopied pathways.
          Farm-to-table meals are served every day. Once the farm for the local
          royal family, the Retreat still has an extensive organic vegetable
          garden, and the meals are served in different alfresco spots around
          the property. A great space to relax after days of culture and
          monuments!

          look for more birds and reptiles. Your afternoon is at leisure, and if
          you’re keen, there’s plenty of birding to be done around the property
          itself.

          possibly the most famous and beautiful building in the world: the Taj
          Mahal, built in the 17th century by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan as a
          tomb and memorial for his wife Mumtaz Mahal. Along the river Yamuna is
          the impressive Red Fort, the capital of the Mughal Empire during the
          16th and 17th centuries.

          Agra has much to offer besides the Taj Mahal, such as Agra Fort, a
          masterpiece of design and construction. You then visit
          Itimad-ud-Daulah’s tomb - better known as the Baby Taj, which also
          features the same marble inlay work as the Taj Mahal. Finally you will
          visit Mehtab Bagh, a formally laid-out Mughal garden that offers
          stupendous views of the Taj Mahal, especially in the late afternoon.

          This 100-year-old building is testimony to India’s long and varied
          history. The low, white colonial building dating back to the Raj era
          is peppered with Mughal paintings and memorabilia, and was host at one
          time to the Crown Princes of England as well as to Mohammad Ali
          Jinnah. The wide lawn in the front, and the cupola-marked pool at the
          back complete the feel of a luxury heritage hotel.

          An early-morning train takes you to Bhopal, the under-rated capital of
          Madhya Pradesh, a surprising mix of medieval Hindu and Islamic
          architecture, and modern town-planning. It is a fast-growing city
          situated on gently-rolling hills and around two man-made lakes. Bhopal
          is perfect for visiting the stupas and abandoned monasteries of
          Sanchi, one of the most important Buddhist sites, and the cave shrines
          of Udaigiri and prehistoric cave paintings of Bhimbetka.

          Built in 1890 and set in 5 sprawling acres, the Jehan Numa Palace
          Hotel is the beautifully-preserved erstwhile home of the rulers of
          Bhopal. The abundance of space has also allowed for airy rooms with
          large beds and stylish colonial furniture in dark wood. Unlike most
          city hotels, Jehan Numa boasts of wide balconies, open lawns,
          fountains and many inviting spots to relax and unwind after a day of
          sightseeing.

          After breakfast, you first visit the amazing prehistoric cave
          dwellings at Bhimbetka. In the boulder-strewn landscape of the Vindhya
          mountain range is a collection of 600 rock shelters dating back to the
          Neolithic Age. Visitors are allowed to venture into 15 of these rock
          shelters to see cave paintings in bold red, white and yellow depicting
          animals, hunts and daily scenes in the lives of people during the
          Stone Age. The UNESCO has acknowledged this treasure by giving it
          World Cultural Heritage status.


          You continue for about three hours to Satpura, a less-known but
          extremely scenic national park, and a great place to simply experience
          the forest. Apart from the beautiful core zone, known for its leopard
          sightings, Satpura’s main feature is the Denwa river; boat safaris and
          canoeing are possible, as are night safaris, cycling and walks in the
          buffer zone, so the experience here goes beyond simply looking for
          tigers.

          There’s nothing quite like exploring Satpura Tiger Reserve in an
          open-top jeep. Accompanied by experienced naturalists and Satpura’s
          local guides, each ride takes you into heart of the wilderness. In an
          effort to reduce the pressure of tourism in the area, the authorities
          restrict the number of vehicles in the reserve, keeping you away from
          crowds and close to all the action.

          meals, and one shared jeep safari with a naturalist per day. Each ride

India's varied terrain and large forest area make it a wonderful destination for birders, and in arid north and central India in particular, the smallest water body becomes a thriving avian metropolis. You start your tour with a multi-day stay at Bharatpur's Keoladeo Ghana bird sanctuary, whose wetlands are home to vast numbers of aquatic birds. You then take a trip on the Chambal river near Agra, a fabulous place to spot a variety of ducks, skimmers, herons and raptors, as well as endangered gharial crocodiles, muggers, turtles and the very rare Gangetic dolphins. A cultural interlude takes you to the fabulous Taj Mahal and the wonderful cave art outside Bhopal, and then you end up at the little-known Satpura national park, a beautiful forest that can be explored by jeep, boat, cycle or even on foot. With close to 400 species of birds and plenty of time in each spot, this is sure to be a momentous birding journey.


### Highlights
* Over two days of birding in the wetlands of Bharatpur's national park
* Boat safaris on the amazing Chambal river
* Jeep safaris in Satpura national park
* Visiting the Taj Mahal in Agra
* Being awed by prehistoric cave paintings in Bhimbetka
