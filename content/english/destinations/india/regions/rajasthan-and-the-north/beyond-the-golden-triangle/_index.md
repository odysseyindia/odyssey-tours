        content: >-
          Today, you have a long drive (about 7 hours), but one on which you see
          India unfold from urban roads to highways to smaller towns and finally
          Rajasthan’s villages. You end up at Mandawa, a small town in the heart
          of Rajasthan’s Shekhavati area, famous for its painted havelis
          (mansions).


          These havelis were built in the 19th century by Marwari merchants who
          decorated them lavishly with frescoes, turning them into status
          symbols and homes for their extended families, providing security and
          comfort in style.

          Located on the outskirts of Mandawa and overlooking fields and sand
          dunes, the unique and atmospheric Desert Resort is a truly original
          place to stay. It’s a purpose-built village, with streets leading to
          clusters of huts and thatched pavilions from which to enjoy the
          surroundings.


          The delightful “mud huts” are surprisingly comfortable, with large
          modern bathrooms, and are brightly decorated with local textiles and
          craftwork. There is an azure swimming pool, and elaborate buffet meals
          are served in the cool dining room, which is decorated with shells.

        content: >-
          Starting at the impressive Mandawa Castle, our guide takes you on a
          stroll around the sandy lanes of this small town. Here you will see
          several of the “painted havelis” for which the region of Shekhawati is
          known.


          Built by wealthy Marwari merchants, some of these large family houses
          are now semi-abandoned, others slowly being restored. The paintings
          depict not only religious scenes, but also many different aspects of
          daily life, including several which display the influence of
          Europeans. Often referred to as an “open-air art gallery”, the
          havelis, and other typical architectural features such as wells and
          memorials, are unique to this area.

          An afternoon camel ride to nearby villages is a good way to get to
          know the Shekhawati desert. It is a short but scenic ride and the
          local people are genuinely pleased to see you. It is surprising how
          well populated the desert is, and there is an ever-changing panorama
          of farmland, wells, and villages to be seen amongst the desert scrub
          from your lofty perch on the camel.

          interesting cities in India, with exuberant 18th- and 19th-century
          palaces and exotic street life. Just outside town is the impressive

          bazaars. Jaipur is well known for its beautiful carpets, enameled
          ornaments, precious and semi-precious stones, brass ornaments and many
          other arts and crafts.

          peace and serenity once you step through the arched gateway. Most of
          the aristocratic families, loyal to the royal house of Jaipur,
          maintained lavish town-houses in Jaipur. Alsisar Haveli is one such
          property. The current head of the family has sympathetically restored
          the old haveli, which now has a lovely swimming pool in a large,
          peaceful garden.

          To experience the life of the Pink City beyond the monuments, it is
          best to join a guided morning walk. Starting in the heart of the Old
          City, you will walk along the busy main streets, lined with parades of
          traditional shops, and explore smaller side streets, each devoted to
          different crafts.


          You will see various tradesmen, such as marble-sculptors and
          bangle-makers at work, visit local temples, see the colourful
          vegetable and flower markets, and sample delicious street foods, such
          as jalebis, rabri, kachoris, and lassi.

          courtyard, which leads to a magnificent complex of palaces, halls,
          pavilions, gardens and temples built over 125 years. There are
          excellent views down over the old town of Amer, and up to the Jaigarh
          and Nahargarh Forts higher in the hills.

          fair reward for your four-hour drive from Jaipur, but it is the base
          for visiting beautiful Ranthambhore National Park. The landscape in
          Ranthambhore is more open than in many other parks, making tiger
          sightings more frequent. Other wildlife includes sambhar, nilgai,
          sloth bear, jackal, crocodile, lots of bird life, and even some
          leopards.

          through various gates to a plateau dotted with ruined palaces, tombs,
          and a popular Ganesh temple. There are fabulous views over the park,
          and this is also a great place for bird-watching.

          sanctuary, Keoladeo Ghana National Park. A network of paths, trails
          and lagoons, this is home to hundreds of species of birds. In winter,
          the resident population of birds is enhanced by many species of
          migratory birds. Bharatpur is a beautiful, peaceful place, enjoyable
          even for non-birders, as motorised vehicles are not allowed, and it
          can be explored on foot, bicycle or cycle rickshaw.

          The best time to visit the sanctuary is in the early mornings and late

          park is by cycle rickshaw, as the drivers are all trained birding
          guides; you can also walk on the smaller trails. When there is enough
          water, you can also take a row-boat ride, to get close to the aquatic
          birds and their nesting colonies.

          After breakfast, drive to the deserted Mughal city of Fatehpur Sikri,
          a complex of sandstone forts, palaces and mosques. This was Emperor
          Akbar’s capital for only 12 years before it was abandoned, apparently
          due to a lack of water. Today it is a ghost city, its architecture
          perfectly preserved. The white marble tomb of Sheikh Salim Chisti,
          Akbar’s spiritual adviser, is a Muslim pilgrimage spot.


          You then drive for an hour to Agra, home to possibly the most famous
          and beautiful building in the world: the Taj Mahal, built in the 17th
          century by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan as a tomb and memorial for
          his wife Mumtaz Mahal. Along the river Yamuna is the impressive Red
          Fort, the capital of the Mughal Empire during the 16th and 17th
          centuries.

          back complete the feel of a luxury heritage hotel.

Rajasthan is India at its exotic and colourful best, with forts, palaces, deserts, tigers, rivers, jungles, temples and just about everything else that the word ‘India’ brings to mind! Women are dressed in colourful saris with chunky jewellery while men wear elaborate turbans and sport huge moustaches. Here you can travel by camel, cycle rickshaw, jeep and boat to explore the myriad attractions.
