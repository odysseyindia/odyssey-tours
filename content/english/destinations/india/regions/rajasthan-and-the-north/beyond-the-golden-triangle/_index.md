          Today, you have a long drive (about 7 hours), but one on which you see
          India unfold from urban roads to highways to smaller towns and finally
          Rajasthan’s villages. You end up at Mandawa, a small town in the heart
          of Rajasthan’s Shekhavati area, famous for its painted havelis
          (mansions). These havelis were built in the 19th century by Marwari
          merchants who decorated them lavishly with frescoes, turning them into
          status symbols and homes for their extended families, providing
          security and comfort in style.

          Located on the outskirts of Mandawa and overlooking fields and sand
          dunes, the unique and atmospheric Desert Resort is a truly original
          place to stay. It’s a purpose-built village, with streets leading to
          clusters of huts and thatched pavilions from which to enjoy the
          surroundings. The delightful “mud huts” are surprisingly comfortable,
          with large modern bathrooms, and are brightly decorated with local
          textiles and craftwork. There is an azure swimming pool, and elaborate
          buffet meals are served in the cool dining room, which is decorated
          with shells.

          Starting at the impressive Mandawa Castle, our guide takes you on a
          stroll around the sandy lanes of this small town. Here you will see
          several of the “painted havelis” for which the region of Shekhawati is
          renowned. Built by wealthy Marwari merchants, some of these large
          family houses are now semi-abandoned, others slowly being restored.
          The paintings depict not only religious scenes, but also many
          different aspects of daily life, including several which display the
          influence of Europeans. Often referred to as an “open-air art
          gallery”, the havelis, and other typical architectural features such
          as wells and memorials, are unique to this area.

          An afternoon camel ride to nearby villages is a good way to get to
          know the Shekhavati desert. It is a short but scenic ride and the
          local people are genuinely pleased to see you. It is surprising how
          well populated the desert is, and there is an ever changing panorama
          of farmland, wells, and villages to be seen amongst the desert scrub
          from your lofty perch on the camel.

          18th- and 19th-century palaces and exotic street life. Just outside
          town is the impressive Amber Fort. It is worthwhile spending time
          wandering through the bazaars. Jaipur is well known for its beautiful
          carpets, enameled ornaments, precious and semi-precious stones, brass
          ornaments and many other arts and crafts.

          City, you will walk along the busy main streets, lined with parades of
          traditional shops, and explore smaller side streets, each devoted to
          different crafts. You will see various tradesmen, such as
          marble-sculptors and bangle-makers at work, visit local temples, see
          the colourful vegetable and flower markets, and sample delicious
          street foods, such as jalebis, rabri, kachoris, and lassi.

          A three-hour drive today takes you to Bharatpur, famous for its bird
          sanctuary, Keoladeo Ghana National Park. A network of paths, trails
          and lagoons, this is home to hundreds of species of birds. In winter,
          the resident population of birds is enhanced by many species of
          migratory birds. Bharatpur is a beautiful, peaceful place, enjoyable
          even for non-birders, as motorised vehicles are not allowed, and it
          can be explored on foot, bicycle or cycle rickshaw.

          also walk on the smaller trails. When there is enough water, you can
          also take a row-boat ride, to get close to the aquatic birds and their
          nesting colonies

          After breakfast, drive to the deserted Mughal city of Fatehpur Sikri,
          a complex of sandstone forts, palaces and mosques. This was Emperor
          Akbar’s capital for only 12 years before it was abandoned, apparently
          due to a lack of water. Today it is a ghost city, its architecture
          perfectly preserved. The white marble tomb of Sheikh Salim Chisti,
          Akbar’s spiritual adviser, is a Muslim pilgrimage spot.


          You continue for an hour to Agra, home to possibly the most famous and
          beautiful building in the world: the Taj Mahal, built in the 17th
          century by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan as a tomb and memorial for
          his wife Mumtaz Mahal. Along the river Yamuna is the impressive Red
          Fort, the capital of the Mughal Empire during the 16th and 17th
          centuries.
