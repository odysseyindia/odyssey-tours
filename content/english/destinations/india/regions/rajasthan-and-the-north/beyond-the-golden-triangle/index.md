Day 1, Delhi
You start your tour on arrival in Delhi, where you will be met by our representative and transferred to your airport hotel, convenient for driving straight to Mandawa the next day.

Suggested hotel: HOLIDAY INN (AEROCITY)
For a comfortable stay before or after a long flight, the Holiday Inn at Aerocity, close to Delhi's International Airport, is ideal. The rooms are large, modern, and, most important of all, quiet. There is a swimming pool, a large restaurant with abundant buffets, a bar, and a speciality Italian restaurant. 



Day 2, Mandawa
Today, you have a long drive (about 7 hours), but one on which you see India unfold from urban roads to highways to smaller towns and finally Rajasthan's villages. You end up at Mandawa, a small town in the heart of Rajasthan's Shekhavati area, famous for its painted havelis (mansions). These havelis were built in the 19th century by Marwari merchants who decorated them lavishly with frescoes, turning them into status symbols and homes for their extended families, providing security and comfort in style.

Suggested hotel: DESERT RESORT
Located on the outskirts of Mandawa and overlooking fields and sand dunes, the unique and atmospheric Desert Resort is a truly original place to stay. It's a purpose-built village, with streets leading to clusters of huts and thatched pavilions from which to enjoy the surroundings. The delightful "mud huts" are surprisingly comfortable, with large modern bathrooms, and are brightly decorated with local textiles and craftwork. There is an azure swimming pool, and elaborate buffet meals are served in the cool dining room, which is decorated with shells.


Day 3, Mandawa

MORNING WALKING TOUR OF MANDAWA
Starting at the impressive Mandawa Castle, our guide takes you on a stroll around the sandy lanes of this small town. Here you will see several of the "painted havelis" for which the region of Shekhawati is known. Built by wealthy Marwari merchants, some of these large family houses are now semi-abandoned, others slowly being restored. The paintings depict not only religious scenes, but also many different aspects of daily life, including several which display the influence of Europeans. Often referred to as an "open-air art gallery", the havelis, and other typical architectural features such as wells and memorials, are unique to this area.

AFTERNOON CAMEL RIDE TO VILLAGES NEAR MANDAWA
An afternoon camel ride to nearby villages is a good way to get to know the Shekhawati desert. It is a short but scenic ride and the local people are genuinely pleased to see you. It is surprising how well populated the desert is, and there is an ever-changing panorama of farmland, wells, and villages to be seen amongst the desert scrub from your lofty perch on the camel.



Day 4, Jaipur

After a pleasant three-hour drive, you reach Jaipur, one of the most interesting cities in India, with exuberant 18th- and 19th-century palaces and exotic street life. Just outside town is the impressive Amber Fort. It is worthwhile spending time wandering through the bazaars. Jaipur is well known for its beautiful carpets, enameled ornaments, precious and semi-precious stones, brass ornaments and many other arts and crafts.

EVENING CULINARY TOUR WITH AN INDIAN HOUSEWIFE, WITH DINNER
You join local resident Payal, a keen cook and food blogger, who will share with you the secrets of her home cooking. She will take you to the food markets of Jaipur to purchase the ingredients for the dishes you will cook together. She will explain the preparation of traditional Rajasthani food, and the use of various spices. Once you have helped prepare the dishes, you get to enjoy them for dinner. With easy-to-follow menus, and after your completely hands-on experience, you will be eager to demonstrate your new skills back home!

Suggested hotel: ALSISAR HAVELI
Just off a busy street near the old walled city, Alsisar Haveli offers peace and serenity once you step through the arched gateway. Most of the aristocratic families, loyal to the royal house of Jaipur, maintained lavish town-houses in Jaipur. Alsisar Haveli is one such property. The current head of the family has sympathetically restored the old haveli, which now has a lovely swimming pool in a large, peaceful garden.
	


Day 5, Jaipur

MORNING WALKING TOUR OF THE PINK CITY
To experience the life of the Pink City beyond the monuments, it is best to join a guided morning walk. Starting in the heart of the Old City, you will walk along the busy main streets, lined with parades of traditional shops, and explore smaller side streets, each devoted to different crafts. You will see various tradesmen, such as marble-sculptors and bangle-makers at work, visit local temples, see the colourful vegetable and flower markets, and sample delicious street foods, such as jalebis, rabri, kachoris, and lassi.

AFTERNOON GUIDED TOUR OF AMBER FORT
Just to the north of Jaipur, Amber Fort overlooks the city from a spur of the Aravalli Hills. There is a short, steep walk up to the entrance courtyard, which leads to a magnificent complex of palaces, halls, pavilions, gardens and temples built over 125 years. There are excellent views down over the old town of Amer, and up to the Jaigarh and Nahargarh Forts higher in the hills.



Day 6, Sawai Madhopur
The busy, dusty town of Sawai Madhopur does not seem at first like fair reward for your four-hour drive from Jaipur, but it is the base for visiting beautiful Ranthambhore National Park. The landscape in Ranthambhore is more open than in many other parks, making tiger sightings more frequent. Other wildlife includes sambhar, nilgai, sloth bear, jackal, crocodile, lots of bird life, and even some leopards.
 
AFTERNOON VISIT OF RANTHAMBHORE FORT
This is a 1,000-year-old fort at the periphery of the National Park, with a spectacular combination of Rajput and Mughal architecture. From the parking area at the base of the fort, a climb of 400 steps winds through various gates to a plateau dotted with ruined palaces, tombs, and a popular Ganesh temple. There are fabulous views over the park, and this is also a great place for bird-watching.

Suggested hotel: TIGER DEN RESORT
A comfortable, friendly resort situated only five minutes away from the park entrance gates, ideal for quick access to game drives. This resort is a mix of cottages set in landscaped gardens, or duplex blocks overlooking the swimming pool. The extensive gardens and the terrace overlooking them are a comfortable place to sit and discuss wildlife sightings. The restaurant serves extensive buffet meals.

	

Day 7, Sawai Madhopur

MORNING AND AFTERNOON JEEP SAFARIS IN RANTHAMBORE N.P.
Ranthambore National Park is one of the best places in India in which to see a tiger in the wild. The varied landscapes within the park are attractive and the wildlife safari by shared jeep is an enjoyable experience even if wildlife proves elusive. 

Morning safaris usually start at around 06:00, and afternoon safaris at around 14:00, and usually last for 3 to 4 hours.



Day 8, Karauli
You continue by road to Karauli, midway between Bharatpur and Ranthambore, and home to a magnificent palace. Built in 1635, the old City Palace is a treasure trove of architecture, stone carvings, gorgeous jali work and classic paintings. Karauli has an interesting bazaar full of exclusive handicrafts, stone carvings and colourful bangles. 

AFTERNOON CAMEL CART RIDE TO OLD CITY PALACE
It is great fun to ride a camel cart through Karauli's narrow market streets to the Old City Palace. The richly-ornamented 18th-century palace has beautiful sandstone cupolas, elaborate stucco-work, spectacular frescoes and an impressive Durbar Hall. The Krishna temple has a regular, lively prayer ceremony that attracts devotees from surrounding villages. You can also explore the colourful market streets on foot.

Suggested hotel: BHANWAR VILAS PALACE
Just outside Karauli is Bhanwar Vilas Palace, the residence of the Maharaja, and a now a beautiful heritage hotel. Staying here feels like stepping back in time: the impressive early-20th-century building has wide, cool verandahs, authentic period furniture and great ambience, with elaborately-furnished rooms. His Highness, Krishna Chandra Pal, often joins guests at dinner when he is in residence. The extensive hotel grounds also boast an old-fashioned swimming pool, a stable, vintage cars, and an organic garden. 



Day 9, Bharatpur
A three-hour drive today takes you to Bharatpur, famous for its bird sanctuary, Keoladeo Ghana National Park. A network of paths, trails and lagoons, this is home to hundreds of species of birds. In winter, the resident population of birds is enhanced by many species of migratory birds. Bharatpur is a beautiful, peaceful place, enjoyable even for non-birders, as motorised vehicles are not allowed, and it 
can be explored on foot, bicycle or cycle rickshaw. 

AFTERNOON VISIT TO THE BIRD SANCTUARY
The best time to visit the sanctuary is in the early mornings and late afternoons, when the birds are most active. The best way to tour the park is by cycle rickshaw, as the drivers are all trained birding guides; you can also walk on the smaller trails. When there is enough water, you can also take a row-boat ride, to get close to the aquatic birds and their nesting colonies.

Suggested hotel: LAXMI VILAS PALACE
This large heritage hotel is the premier place to stay in Bharatpur. Laxmi Vilas is the older, 18th-century wing of the palace, with comfortable, well-furnished rooms. Between the two wings is an enticing swimming pool. The entire property is surrounded by extensive lawns giving it a rural and relaxing feel.
	


Day 10, Agra
After breakfast, drive to the deserted Mughal city of Fatehpur Sikri, a complex of sandstone forts, palaces and mosques. This was Emperor Akbar's capital for only 12 years before it was abandoned, apparently due to a lack of water. Today it is a ghost city, its architecture perfectly preserved. The white marble tomb of Sheikh Salim Chisti, Akbar's spiritual adviser, is a Muslim pilgrimage spot. 
 
AGRA
You continue for an hour to Agra, home to possibly the most famous and beautiful building in the world: the Taj Mahal, built in the 17th century by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan as a tomb and memorial for his wife Mumtaz Mahal. Along the river Yamuna is the impressive Red Fort, the capital of the Mughal Empire during the 16th and 17th centuries.

AFTERNOON GUIDED TOUR OF AGRA'S OTHER MONUMENTS
Agra has much to offer besides the Taj Mahal, such as Agra Fort, a masterpiece of design and construction. You then visit Itimad-ud-Daulah's tomb - better known as the Baby Taj, which also features the same marble inlay work as the Taj Mahal. Finally you will visit Mehtab Bagh, a formally laid-out Mughal garden that offers stupendous views of the Taj Mahal, especially in the late afternoon.

Suggested hotel: THE GRAND IMPERIAL
This 100-year-old building is testimony to India's long and varied history. The low, white colonial building dating back to the Raj era is peppered with Mughal paintings and memorabilia, and was host at one time to the Crown Princes of England as well as to Mohammad Ali Jinnah. The wide lawn in the front, and the cupola-marked pool at the back complete the feel of a luxury heritage hotel.   

	

Day 11, Delhi

EARLY MORNING VISIT ON YOUR OWN TO THE TAJ MAHAL 
The best time of day to appreciate this stunning monument is as soon as the Taj Mahal opens, when it is at its quietest and most serene. You can enjoy the gardens, the mausoleum and the mosque, without needing a professional guide. Don't miss the marble inlay work and the various vantage points offered throughout the peaceful gardens. Once you have taken it all in, you can return to your hotel for a late breakfast.

The rest of the day is at leisure for you to explore Agra on your own. In the evening you take a quick, comfortable train to Delhi. 

Suggested hotel: THE METROPOLITAN HOTEL
Located close to Connaught Place, in the centre of New Delhi, this quiet, upmarket hotel has a fresh atmosphere with vivid, minimalist, stylish designs. The hotel has 3 restaurants including one serving authentic Japanese cuisine. There is a swimming pool, an excellent large spa, a fashion & lifestyle store and an art gallery.


Day 12, Delhi
You have the day to explore Delhi on your own. Delhi is practically two cities: New Delhi, the capital of India, and medieval Old Delhi. The old city centres around the Red Fort, which contains opulent palaces and impressive public buildings. Nearby is the magnificent Jama Masjid, India’s largest mosque. In New Delhi you can find India Gate - a war memorial arch, the impressive Parliament Building and Rashtrapati Bhawan, the residence of the President. Towards the South are Qutab Minar and Humayun's Tomb, both World Heritage Sites.

In the evening, you have a departure transfer from your hotel to Delhi International airport, to board your onward flight.
