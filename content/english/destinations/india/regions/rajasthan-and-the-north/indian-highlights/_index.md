          Today, you drive to Jaipur, which takes about five hours along a good,
          if busy, highway, with time to just relax afterwards. The capital of
          the state of Rajasthan is one of the most interesting cities in India,
          with exuberant 18th- and 19th-century palaces and exotic street life.
          Just outside town is the impressive Amber Fort. It is worthwhile
          spending time wandering through the bazaars. Jaipur is well known for
          its beautiful carpets, enameled ornaments, precious and semi-precious
          stones, brass ornaments and many other arts and crafts.

          In the early morning, you join a small group of like-minded travellers
          for a unique journey by bicycle into the streets of the old city. You
          experience the true Jaipur, as you cycle through the narrow alleys to
          get a peek into homes, kitchens and workshops. You learn about the
          lives of the locals and the history of the city, and visit the
          colourful and bustling vegetable and flower markets. You also enjoy a
          traditional Rajasthani breakfast in a local house.

          You will meet your guide directly after the cycling tour, who will
          accompany you to Amber Fort, just to the north of Jaipur. There is a
          short, steep walk up to the entrance courtyard, which leads to a
          magnificent complex of palaces, halls, pavilions, gardens and temples
          built over 125 years. There are excellent views down over the old town
          of Amer, and up to the Jaigarh and Nahargarh Forts higher in the
          hills. The rest of your day is at leisure to explore Jaipur’s lovely
          markets on your own.

Depending on the stops you make, the drive takes from five hours to most of the day.\_ Agra is home to possibly the most famous and beautiful building in the world: the Taj Mahal, built in the 17th century by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan as a tomb and memorial for his wife Mumtaz Mahal. Along the river Yamuna is the impressive Red Fort, the capital of the Mughal Empire during the 16th and 17th centuries."

          The best time of day to appreciate this stunning monument is as soon
          as the Taj Mahal opens, when it is at its quietest and most serene.
          You can enjoy the gardens, the mausoleum and the mosque. Don’t miss
          the marble inlay work and the various vantage points offered
          throughout the peaceful gardens. You can carry mobile phones, cameras,
          a water bottle and valuables inside, but all other items must be
          deposited in safety lockers at the entry gate. You are then free to
          enter the grounds of the Taj Mahal for a maximum of three hours. Once
          you have taken it all in, you can return to your hotel for a late
          breakfast.

          Agra has much to offer besides the Taj Mahal, such as Agra Fort, a
          masterpiece of design and construction. You then visit
          Itimad-ud-Daulah’s tomb - better known as the Baby Taj, which also
          features the same marble inlay work as the Taj Mahal. Finally you will
          visit Mehtab Bagh, a formally laid-out Mughal garden that offers
          stupendous views of the Taj Mahal, especially in the late afternoon.

          Today, you drive back to Delhi along the Yamuna Expressway, which
          should take about 4 hours. The rest of your day is at leisure, to
          either rest or to explore on your own.


          Delhi is practically two cities: New Delhi, the capital of India, and
          medieval Old Delhi. The old city centres around the Red Fort, which
          contains opulent palaces and impressive public buildings. Nearby is
          the magnificent Jama Masjid, India’s largest mosque. In New Delhi you
          can find India Gate - a war memorial arch, the impressive Parliament
          Building and Rashtrapati Bhawan, the residence of the President.
          Towards the South are Qutab Minar and Humayun’s Tomb, both World
          Heritage Sites.

        content: >-
          A half-day tour to Old Delhi using the modern Metro and the
          traditional cycle rickshaw. The Metro brings you to the heart of Old
          Delhi in just a few minutes, to visit the magnificent Jama Masjid
          mosque, India’s largest. You then use walk and ride cycle rickshaws
          through the fascinating maze of narrow streets around the main street
          of Old Delhi, Chandni Chowk, a bustling jumble of craft shops,
          traders, mosques and temples.


          At one end of this street is the huge Red Fort, the symbol of Delhi,
          which contains within it palaces and impressive public buildings.
          (Please note, though, that we will not go inside the Red Fort, because
          on this tour we concentrate on the narrow alleys and atmosphere of Old
          Delhi. However, you could arrange with your local guide to see the Red
          Fort at the end of your half-day tour). At the other end of Chandni
          Chowk is the colourful and aromatic Spice Market, the roof of which
          offers great views over Old Delhi. You can also visit the bustling and
          colourful Sikh Gurdwara.


          The rest of your day is at leisure. If you’d like to go shopping or
          explore a bit more after the tour, you can take the Metro to vibrant
          Connaught Place to enjoy the many restaurants and more modern shops.
