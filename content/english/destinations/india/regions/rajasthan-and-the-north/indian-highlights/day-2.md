Today, you drive to Jaipur, which takes about five hours along a good, if busy, highway, with time to just relax afterwards. 

The capital of the state of Rajasthan is one of the most interesting cities in India, with exuberant 18th- and 19th-century palaces and exotic street life. Just outside town is the impressive Amber Fort. It is worthwhile spending time wandering through the bazaars. Jaipur is well known for its beautiful carpets, enameled ornaments, precious and semi-precious stones, brass ornaments and many other arts and crafts.

### Suggested hotel: Dera Rawatsar

Dera Rawatsar is a family-run boutique hotel, warm as a home. Located just behind the bus station, Dera Rawatsar lies in a quiet, leafy lane. Within its walls are small courtyards and terraces, lawns and secluded corners. The well-decorated and traditionally-furnished rooms are all different. Meals, drinks and snacks are served in the family's dining room or the outdoor courtyard. There is also a small swimming pool.
