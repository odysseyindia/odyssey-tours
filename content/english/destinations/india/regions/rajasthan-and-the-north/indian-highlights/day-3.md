### Early Morning Cycle Tour Of Jaipur
In the early morning, you join a small group for a unique journey by bicycle into the streets of the old city. You will experience the true Jaipur as you cycle through the narrow alleys to get a peek into homes, kitchens and workshops. You learn about the lives of the locals and the history of the city, and visit the colourful and bustling vegetable and flower markets. You will also enjoy a traditional Rajasthani breakfast in a local house.

### Morning Guided Excursion To Amber Fort
You will meet your guide directly after the cycling tour, who will accompany you to Amber Fort, just to the north of Jaipur. There is a short, steep walk up to the entrance courtyard, which leads to a magnificent complex of palaces, halls, pavilions, gardens and temples built over 125 years. There are excellent views down over the old town of Amer, and up to the Jaigarh and Nahargarh Forts higher in the hills.

The rest of your day is at leisure to explore Jaipur's lovely markets on your own.
