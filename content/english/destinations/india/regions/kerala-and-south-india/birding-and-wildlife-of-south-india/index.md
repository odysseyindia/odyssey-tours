Day 1, Kochi
Your tour begins at Kochi airport, where you are met by our representative and transferred to your hotel. Kochi (or Cochin) is set on a cluster of islands and narrow peninsulas and has one of the best natural harbours in the world. The famed `Malabar Spices' were exported from this very port, bringing to Kochi visitors as varied as the Arabs, the Dutch, the Portuguese and, finally, the British. All of them have left their mark on the architecture, making Kochi one of the most unique and fascinating towns in India.

Suggested hotel: OLD HARBOUR HOTEL
This is one of the true gems of Fort Cochin. Located only a street away from the waterfront and the famous Chinese fishing nets, the Old Harbour Hotel enjoys a superb location. The Old Harbour Hotel has characterful rooms, nooks and corridors dotted with antiques, and a beautiful poolside area in the shade of huge rain trees, perfect for relaxing with a beer.


	
Day 2, Kochi

MORNING GUIDED TOUR OF FORT COCHIN
At the entrance of Kochi harbour, the Chinese fishing nets are fascinating. A short walk away is St Francis Church, built by the Portuguese in 1510. Vasco da Gama, who died in 1524, was buried here. Also in Fort Kochi is a 17th-century Jewish synagogue. Scrolls of the Old Testament and copper plates inscribed in Hebrew are preserved here. There is also the 'Dutch' Palace, built by the Portuguese for the Raja of Cochin in 1555.

EVENING KATHAKALI DANCE PERFORMANCE
This evening, you get to catch an evening performance of kathakali and other dances from Kerala. In kathakali, the actors depict characters from the Puranas and the Mahabharata - superhuman beings, demons, and ordinary men and women. The dancers, all males, adorn themselves in huge skirts and headdress, wearing what must surely be the most intricate make-up of any dance style in the world.



Day 3, Thattekad
After breakfast, drive about three hours to Thattekad, site of the Salim Ali Bird Sanctuary, designed by the renowned ornithologist of India, Dr. Salim Ali. The sanctuary, nestled in evergreen forests, is noted for indigenous birds like the Malabar grey hornbill. Rare birds like the Ceylon frogmouth and the mottled wood owl are also seen here.

AFTERNOON BIRDING WALK
Thattekad Bird Sanctuary is one of the richest bird habitats in peninsular India, with over 270 species. You can take walking tours through a small section of the sanctuary, and visit the welcome centre and lovely butterfly garden. You could see the rare Mottled Wood Owl, Spot-bellied Eagle Owl, Malayan Night Heron, Sri Lanka Frogmouth, Rusty-tailed Flycatcher, Grey-headed Bulbul and the Nilgiri Wood Pigeon. 

Suggested hotel: THE HORNBILL CAMP
Set amidst a coconut grove on the banks of the Periyar River, the Hornbill Camp consists of simple cottage tents built on raised platforms. The camp overlooks the lowland forests of the Salim Ali Bird Sanctuary. There is no better place to go birding, kayaking on the Periyar river or cycling through the spice-growing villages of Kerala. A variety of activities are offered, from nature walks to archery. 
	
	

Day 4, Thattekad
You have another birding walk in the early morning in the bird sanctuary. 

FULL DAY AT LEISURE FOR WALKING, CYCLING & KAYAKING
The rest of your day is free for the many complimentary activities at The Hornbill Camp, including a plantation walk, a cycling trip and a kayaking adventure. The quiet and lush countryside is ideal for walkers to discover Kerala through its trails and villages. You can explore a rubber estate, a spice plantation and numerous farms, and a magnificent dam. You can also kayak to some of the spice-growing villages upstream. 

	

Day 5, Munnar
After breakfast, drive right into the Western Ghats, a hill range known for its incredible biodiversity, including several endemic species and endangered ones. Your two-hour drive today takes you to Munnar. Sprawling tea plantations, picture-book towns with old Raj-style bungalows, winding lanes and cool air make Munnar the perfect place for a relaxed holiday. Munnar also has the highest peak in South India, Anaimudi. Here you also find the Eravikulam/Rajamalai National Park, the last stronghold of the world's rarest mountain goat, the Nilgiri tahr.

The rest of your day is at leisure to explore the plantation and walks around your resort - you can arrange these on the spot.

Suggested hotel: WINDERMERE ESTATE
A delightful farmhouse-style resort in the hills, 3km from Munnar. With great views of the surrounding mountains, Windermere has a quiet and subtle charm. Set in a cardamom and tea estate and located high in the hills, there are cottages in different styles - all of them are spacious and well furnished with sturdy wooden pieces. There is a pool, a lovely library and restaurant, plus nice sitouts and a great viewing point.



Day 6, Munnar

MORNING EXCURSION TO ERAVIKULAM NATIONAL PARK AND THE TEA MUSEUM IN MUNNAR
To get up close to some of the world's last Nilgiri tahr (a variety of mountain goat or ibex), visit nearby Eravikulam National Park. Existing only in the mountain grasslands of the Western Ghats at altitudes above 2,000m (6,400 ft), the tahr is as endangered as the tiger. You walk along an often-foggy road lined, with easy sightings: the tahrs have grown so used to visitors that you can get within a few yards of them.

Tata Tea recently opened a Tea Museum at the Nallathanni Estate of Tata Tea in Munnar which houses curios, photographs and machinery, each depicting a turning point that contributed to a flourishing tea industry, as seen today in the region. You can visit this museum after descending from Eravikulam. 



Day 7, Thekkady
Thekkady is the gateway town for Periyar Wildlife Reserve. The three-hour journey to Thekkady affords some beautiful views of the highest mountain range in India south of the Himalayas. 

Suggested hotel: SHALIMAR SPICE GARDEN
A peaceful retreat surrounded by fruit trees and spice gardens with a gurgling stream running through it. The cottages are simple but well furnished in colours that blend with the environment. A great deal of attention has been lavished on the large, immaculately-designed bathrooms. There is a lovely swimming pool and Ayurvedic massage and yoga centre, and even a library with a fireplace



Day 8, Thekkady

MORNING NATURE WALK IN PERIYAR WILDLIFE SANCTUARY
Different nature trails traversing diverse habitats form the trekking routes, generally 4 to 5km in length. This nature walk, suitable for adults and for kids above 13, offers an excellent opportunity to watch birds, butterflies and other wildlife. The trails often pass through evergreen and moist deciduous forests interspersed with marshy grasslands.   

AFTRNOON VISIT TO A SPICE PLANTATION
As you take a walk along the winding pathways among the plantations, the thing that strikes you first is the lingering aroma, of cloves, nutmeg, pepper, cinnamon or cardamom. Learn about the medicinal and culinary uses of these spices, and about the geographical and climatic peculiarities of Thekkady such as the cool climate and its elevation above sea level, which make it ideal for spice cultivation. 



Day 9, Dindigul
Today, you cross over into Tamil Nadu. A four-hour drive takes you to Dindigul, a large market town that handles the produce of the surrounding hills, mainly fruit, including a renowned local variety of banana. Dindigul is particularly known for its cheroots (cigars). A massive granite fort towers above the town and presents magnificent views of the town, the valley and the hills on either side.

Athoor Lake, just outside Dindigul, is the largest water-body in the area, and a great spot for birding. You can arrange a birding trail at your homestay.
 
Suggested hotel: CARDAMOM HOUSE
Cardamom House is owned by a retired British physician. The atmosphere is informal, and the daily activities of the house are tailored to accommodate the personal programmes of the guests. It is a small homestay with 6 double rooms and a suite which can also be divided into two separate rooms. All rooms are named after an Indian spice or herb, and all have superb views of Athoor Lake and the Western Ghats.



Day 10, Perumparai
Drive an hour into the hills above Dindigul, and find yourself at the small hill village of Perumparai. A little way off the beaten track (yet very accessible from cities like Madurai), this region is known for its plantations and wonderful views.

The area is well known for its bird watching opportunities with over 200 species of migratory birds. The next two days are at leisure to do some birding, explore the property, and enjoy the excellent food. 

Suggested hotel: RAJAKKAD ESTATE
Rajakkad Estate is a coffee and fruit plantation, best known for Palam Palace, an 18th-century Kerala house transported here and put back together like a jigsaw puzzle. While the exterior of the house is traditional, the interior is surprisingly chic, all white and cheerful. The estate offers excellent farm-to-table meals, lots of spots around the property to relax, nature walks, a lovely library, and a great sense of peace.



Day 11, Perumparai

BIRD-WATCHING AT RAJAKKAD ESTATE
You come to Rajakkad Estate for the great outdoors; there are 60 acres of farm, forests and plantations, criss-crossed with hiking trails and stunning views. It’s a birdwatcher’s paradise with the Golden Oriole and Fairy Bluebirds amongst many other birds.	



Day 12, Kodaikanal
A winding two-hour drive takes you up into the Palani Hills, to the hill station of Kodaikanal. 
Also called Kodai, its cool temperatures and the beautiful scent of pine and eucalyptus make it a popular retreat from the plains. Set at a high altitude, a journey to Kodai affords breathtaking views of the hills and valleys. Kodaikanal has many Raj-era houses and flower-filled gardens add atmosphere, while many quiet paths lead through the forests to spectacular waterfalls and viewpoints.

The next two days are for you to explore the resort's grounds (a light hike in itself), and the surrounding forest.

Suggested hotel: ELEPHANT VALLEY ECO FARM HOTEL
Elephant Valley is a wonderful resort at the edge of the forest. The cottages have been tastefully created using local granite and reclaimed Burma teak wood, with interiors of colonial and art deco furniture. Set close to a reserve forest, you will find yourself surrounded by birds and beautiful trees, and might even spot elephants! Short and long hikes are easily possible, and there are both great views and great food.



Day 13, Kodaikanal

FULL DAY AT LEISURE TO EXPLORE ELEPHANT VALLEY
Elephant Valley lies along the migration route of the pachyderms, and they are often found close to the resort. Follow nature trails of various lengths to admire the tremendous biodiversity of the region. Around varieties of wild orchids, old palms and ferns, you may see bisons, elephant families, and other smaller mammals. Some rare bird species can be seen here, like the majestic black eagle and the sweet Malabar whistler. 

You can do a full-day trek, or shorter treks, or even just a fascinating walk around the property, including a rope bridge and a riverside walk. You can book all of these on the spot at the hotel.



Day 14, Pollachi
Today, a four-hour drive takes you to Pollachi, a small agricultural town just over an hour from Coimbatore. A pleasantly green place, it is located close to the Western Ghats, a critical biodiversity region. It offers a good base from which to explore wildlife reserves like Topslip and Parambikulam, and is also a good mid-way halt between the hill stations of Tamil Nadu and the tea estates of Kerala.

You are at leisure today to just relax at the hotel, or the hotel can help organise activities to explore the region.

Suggested hotel: COCO LAGOON RESORT BY GREAT MOUNT
Set in a coconut grove, and with a lovely lagoon in the centre, this hotel offers a relaxed stay in the sleepy district of Pollachi. The resort comprises earth-coloured cottages with comfortable interiors, a swimming pool, a multicuisine restaurant and an ayurveda spa. 



Day 15, Ootacamund
A steep drive with great views, lasting about five hours, takes you to cool, inviting Ooty. Originally a Toda tribal village, Ooty (or Udhagamandalam) was established as a hill resort by the British in the 19th 
century. It has a lingering touch of the Raj in the English cottages, clubs, boarding schools and churches. Ooty is spread over a large area amongst rolling hills and valleys, with a lovely lake and racecourse. There are also Botanical Gardens here with immaculate lawns housing hundreds of varieties of plants.

Suggested hotel: SAVOY HOTEL
The best place to stay in Ooty. High on the slopes of a hill, the Savoy, operated by the Taj hotels, sprawls over six acres of landscaped gardens, offering colonial-style cottages built between 1834 and 1865. The rooms have a colonial atmosphere with working fireplaces, wooden floors and brass fittings. Colorful flowerbeds merge to form a multi-coloured quilt around the cottages, adding to the old English Charm.



Day 16, Ootacamund

DAY AT LEISURE TO EXPLORE OOTY
Trace the remnants of the British colonial era such as St. Stephen’s Church, the Nilgiris’ oldest church built in 1829, and the beautifully terraced Botanical Gardens, established in 1848, a living gallery of the Nilgiris’ natural flora. Go for a stroll in the Rose Garden, with over 20,000 rose bushes of more than 2,000 varieties (best between May and July), from where you can also enjoy the views over Ooty. On clear days, you can get even better views at Doddabetta, about 7 km east of Ooty, which is the highest point (2,633m) in the Nilgiris. 

An added attraction for travellers to Ooty is the toy train journey which winds its way up the mountain from Mettupulayam in 4 to 5 hours. You can drive to nearby Coonoor and take the toy train back up to Ooty for a shorter train ride.



Day 17, Nagarhole
Descending to the plains takes you to Nagarhole National Park, about five hours away. Nagarhole National Park extends north of the Kabini River, which was dammed in 1974 to form a picturesque artificial lake. This perennial water source attracts large numbers of animals. The park has elephants, gaur, dhole (wild dogs), wild cats, four-horned antelopes, flying squirrels, sloth bears, monkeys, sambhar deer, panthers and many varieties of birds, as well as tigers.

Day 19, Mysore
A two-hour drive today gets you to Mysore, a friendly and easy-going city with a pleasant climate. With a number of beautiful palaces and pre-Independence architecture, Mysore has a faded grandeur and small-town charm. The city is a crafts centre, and has numerous shops selling a wide range of sandalwood, rosewood and teak carvings, furniture, traditional Mysore silk, puppets and lacquer-ware and other handicrafts.

The rest of the day is free for you to relax.

Suggested hotel: ROYAL ORCHID METROPOLE HOTEL
This hotel was originally built by the Wodeyar ruling family of Mysore, and has considerable old-world charm. Built to house the Maharaja's British guests, the building consists of rooms that still bear graceful writing desks, claw-foot bathtubs and winged armchairs. There's also a very pleasant pool area, and a nice courtyard with seating under majestic old trees, and a coffee shop, plus an atmospheric bar.



Day 20, Mysore

MORNING GUIDED TOUR OF MYSORE
The focal point of the city is the 19th-century Maharaja's Palace. Part of it is still used by the royal family on festive occasions; the other part is a museum. The collection, which includes a golden howdah (elephant saddle) that kings used during processions, gives a taste of the splendid lifestyle of the Wodeyar rulers of Mysore. 

The Wodeyars were devoted to the goddess Chamundesvari, enshrined on Chamundi Hill (13km away). Half way up the hill is a gigantic monolithic Nandi Bull, about 5m high. There is also a 12th-century temple dedicated to the goddess.


The afternoon is at leisure.

Just a little north of Mysore, this lovely wetland is host to some 170 species of birds, including  the painted stork, Asian openbill stork, common spoonbill, woolly-necked stork, black-headed ibis, lesser whistling duck, stork-billed kingfisher, and more. In the winter, up to 40,000 migrants from Siberia, Latin America and northern India find their way here, making it an ornithologist's paradise. Ranger-guided boat tours are available, and are a good way to see the park.
	
BANGALORE
You continue to Bangalore, the Silicon Valley of India. This pleasant city has beautiful parks, avenues and impressive buildings. Parts of the city are amongst the most modern and Westernised areas of India, replete with shopping malls, microbreweries, bars and restaurants.

Suggested hotel: THE TAJ WEST END
A delightful hotel set in twenty acres of landscaped gardens, with a lot of old world charm that makes it feel more like a club.
