          Formerly known as Madras, this is the capital of the state of Tamil
          Nadu. Chennai boasts of one of the longest city beaches in the world,
          and Marina Beach provides a refreshing contrast to the busy city
          centre.


          The Fort St. George area contains many reminders from the time the
          British established the East India Trading Company in the 17th
          century, including the oldest surviving Anglican church in Asia, the
          St. Mary’s Church.

          This lovely walking tour is less about monuments and more about
          stories. It is an easy walk through Mylapore, the old part of Chennai,
          exploring fascinating stories hidden away in the mundane rituals of
          daily life. You hear the stories behind everyday sights, stories of
          gods and demons, of ancient customs and symbolisms, and of Mylapore
          and Madras, and end with a delicious snack at a local eatery.

          shrines and the legendary Shore Temple are now a World Heritage Site.


          The stunning archaeological remains co-exist with a long white-sand

          The famous shore temple of Mamallapuram stands on the seashore with
          its paved forecourts. Early rock-cut temples excavated from the
          hillside near the centre of the village have large carved panels
          depicting stories from Indian mythology.


          Several man-made caves are scattered through the area. Then there are
          the rathas, “chariots”, carved in situ from single boulders, to
          resemble temples or the chariots used in temple processions.

          Today, you continue for two hours down the coastal road to the lovely
          old French colony of Pondicherry.


          One can experience the colonial charm of the town by walking through
          its old quarter, which houses a varied collection of buildings,
          churches, homes, markets and thoroughfares with French names.


          You can also visit nearby Auroville, an interesting experiment in
          alternative living, with a very informative Visitors' Centre, and nice
          cafes and shops.

          Pondicherry. The quaint boulevards and sleepy streets will come alive
          as you explore the city’s colonial past.


          Behind every charming façade are incredible stories, like a general
          bravely fighting a battle when the war itself was over, poets and
          revolutionaries hiding from the law, the connection between milk,
          Pondicherry and Saigon, and much more.

          spacious and uncluttered. Fine period-inspired furnishings provide
          just the right finishing touch.


          There is an inviting plunge pool in the courtyard, and an Ayurvedic
          massage and treatment centre. The restaurants whip up French
          delicacies, Continental fare and local cuisine with equal ease.

        title: Kumbakonam
        content: >-
          You continue southwards today, stopping at the temple town of
          Chidambaram. One of Tamil Nadu’s most important holy towns,
          Chidambaram was the capital of the Chola empire for 400 years. The
          great Nataraja temple, dedicated to the dancing Shiva, was built
          during this period, and is one of the finest examples of Dravidian
          architecture. This huge complex is still an active temple, with
          Brahmins at every shrine. A visit to the temple affords a fascinating
          glimpse into ancient Tamil religious practice.


          You continue on to Kumbakonam. Legend has it that the Hindu god Shiva
          broke a kumbh (water pot) here, after it was brought here by a great
          flood. As a result this busy market town has many large and colourful
          temples dedicated to Shiva, some with highly refined Chola stone
          carving. Nearby at Darasuram is a magnificent 12th-century Chola
          temple, which should not be missed. The village of Swamimalai, just a
          bike ride away, is the state’s principal centre for traditional
          bronze-casting.

          Near the temple town of Kumbakonam, Mantra Koodam is designed like an
          ‘agraharam’ - a characteristically Brahmin street lined with ‘illams’
          (homes). The cottages are designed like traditional Tamil homes – with
          large verandahs, Athangudi floor tiles, ornate Burmese teak doors and
          open-to-air bathrooms. Strolling through the property, you will come
          across lush coconut groves, temple shrines and the occasional peacock.

          Your morning is at leisure in Kumbakonam to explore the nearby temples
          on your own.


          After lunch, drive an hour to Thanjavur. The chief attraction of
          Thanjavur (or Tanjore) is the extraordinary Brihadishwara Temple.
          Built in 1010 by the Chola dynasty, who ruled much of Southern India
          for over 400 years, the temple is now a World Heritage monument. The
          immense main temple is over 60m high, and is hewn from a single piece
          of granite estimated to weigh 80 tonnes. An astonishing sight, one of
          the highlights of a trip to South India.

          Svatma is a luxurious wellness resort in a quiet corner of Thanjavur.
          There’s an air of calm throughout, from the rooms to the stylish pool
          area to the spa.


          You can get a health regimen here based on the Vedic principles of
          ‘siddha’, even a treatment in the ‘sound spa’, where the resonance of
          gongs and chimes provides healing vibrations. The food is extremely
          good (and healthy!), and there’s a proper bar up on the top floor!

          Within its enormous compound, the chief attraction of the
          Brihadishwara Temple complex is the main temple. The temple consists
          of an octagonal cupolic dome, resting on a single square block of
          granite estimated to weigh 80 tonnes. The moulded plinth is
          extensively engraved with inscriptions. On the walls of the inner
          passages are life-size iconographic representations of various Hindu
          deities.


          A huge nandi bull faces the inner sanctum. Created from a single piece
          of rock, it weighs 25 tonnes and is one of India’s largest nandi
          statues.


          Your afternoon is at leisure, if you wish to explore the markets,
          visit the temple in the evening, or enjoy a treatment at the hotel.

          Today, you get to visit two grand temple complexes.


          The first is at Trichy, or Tiruchirapalli. This superb 13th-century
          temple complex with colourful bazaars has 21 carved gopurams or temple
          archways and is set on a 250-hectare island in the Cauvery river,
          connected to the mainland by a bridge.


          If you have the time (and have been doing your cardio exercises),
          there is also Trichy’s Rock Fort temple, reached by climbing up a
          tunnel of 437 steps to a splendid view.

          colourful bazaars, street tailors, throngs of pilgrims and joyful
          religious processions, Madurai is a bustling city that attracts
          thousands of visitors each day.


          Madurai’s main attraction is the famous temple dedicated to the
          Goddess Meenakshi. Each evening, there is a closing ceremony,
          accompanied by chanting priests, drummers and torchbearers in which an
          image of Shiva is carried in procession to Parvati’s bedroom.

          artfully renovated; the result is a hotel with lots of charm, and huge
          rooms.


          The restaurant serves Indian and international cuisine and there is a
          magnificent swimming pool to enjoy. There is also a ‘heritage

          The Meenakshi temple is one of the finest and largest examples of
          Dravidian architecture. Its musical pillars, each of which is carved
          out of a single block of granite, let out musical notes when tapped.
          There is also the hall of a Thousand Pillars, part of which has
          converted into a museum.


          The Thirumalai Nayak Palace is situated 1km from the temple. Built in
          1636 by the king Thirumalai Nayak, it has pillars in Italian style, a
          Mughal arch and Dravidian decoration. The Vandiyur Mariamman Tank is a
          huge temple tank with a mandapam in the centre. During the ‘Floating
          Festival’ , the temple deities are taken out in the tank on floats.

Temples in the Tamil tradition are utterly distinctive: gopurams (spires) rising well above the skyline, elaborately decorated with celestial figures and often rainbow-coloured, and like nothing else on Earth. But the temples are only the outward expression of a millenia-old religion, and spending time at the temples is a great way to learn about South Indian Hinduism. You’ll travel to amazing temples in Chennai, Mamallapuram, Kumbakonam and Thanjavur, ending with the huge Meenakshi temple in Madurai. You’ll explore through stories, guided tours, a night ceremony and more.
