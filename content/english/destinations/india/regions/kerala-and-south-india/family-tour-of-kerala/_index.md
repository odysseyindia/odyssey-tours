        content: >-
          Kochi (or Cochin) is set on a cluster of islands and narrow peninsulas
          and has one of the best natural harbours in the world. The famed
          ‘Malabar Spices’ were exported from this very port, bringing to Kochi
          visitors as varied as the Arabs, the Dutch, the Portuguese and,
          finally, the British. All of them have left their mark on the
          architecture, making Kochi one of the most unique and fascinating
          towns in India.

          The Fort House is one of the older establishments on the waterfront of
          Fort Cochin. This atmospheric property has offers over twenty pleasant
          rooms and a nice garden with an ayurveda centre.


          The restaurant on the waterfront is a big draw - not just for its
          location, but also its seafood specialties. Tourists as well as Kochi
          residents are regular visitors here, and they come to enjoy the
          evening views of the harbour.

          At the entrance of Kochi harbour, the Chinese fishing nets are
          fascinating. A short walk away is St Francis Church, built by the
          Portuguese in 1510. Vasco da Gama, who died in 1524, was buried here.


          Also in Fort Kochi is a 17th-century Jewish synagogue. Scrolls of the
          Old Testament and copper plates inscribed in Hebrew are preserved
          here. There is also the ‘Dutch’ Palace, built by the Portuguese for
          the Raja of Cochin in 1555.

          This evening, you get to catch an evening performance of kathakali and
          other dances from Kerala. In kathakali, the actors depict characters
          from the Puranas and the Mahabharata - superhuman beings, demons, and
          ordinary men and women.


          The dancers, all males, adorn themselves in huge skirts and headdress,
          wearing what must surely be the most intricate make-up of any dance
          style in the world.

          A short drive from Alleppey, Mararikulam (generally shortened to
          Marari) offers one of the most fabulous stretches of soft sandy beach,
          fringed with swaying palms. In the village, life still goes on much as
          it did a hundred years ago, with the men going out to sea each day to
          earn a living bringing in the daily catch. It is an idyllic retreat
          for those who want to “get away from it all”.


          You have two full days to simply enjoy the beach, and perhaps explore
          the village on foot or by bicycle.

Kerala is a fantastic place to go with a family - its short driving times, beaches, hills and warm homestays make it a very easy choice. You’ll get to explore colonial-era Fort Kochi, then go on to a tented camp by the river in Thattekad, with cycling, archery, kayaking, birding and many other activities. You then carry on to a plantation homestay with excellent food and the chance to pick your own spices, then to a relaxed resort on Kerala’s famous backwaters. You end with pure beach time at pristine Mararikulam.
