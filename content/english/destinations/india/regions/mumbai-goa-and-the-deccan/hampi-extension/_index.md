          Today, you arrive in Hampi, where you are taken directly to your
          hotel. The rest of your day is at leisure.


          Hampi was the capital of the Vijayanagar empire from 1336 to 1565. The
          city was well planned, with an efficient sewage system, a bustling
          marketplace full of luxurious goods, and countless palaces and
          temples. Today, the extensive ruins at Hampi tell a mysterious story
          about a bygone civilization. The landscape is remarkable, with miles
          and miles of granite boulders and huge rock formations standing
          against the blue skies.

          Across the river from Hampi, in the heritage village of Anegundi, is a
          small but prettily landscaped boutique property called Uramma
          Cottages. The attractive cottages look out onto the lawn, and are
          distinctively furnished using local fabrics. There is a restaurant
          serving excellent local dishes.


          The friendly staff can take guests for a stroll around the village to
          see the various other eco-tourism initiatives which the owners of the
          hotel are involved in, such as a school, library, weaving centre, and
          craft centre. Mountain bikes are available to explore the surrounding
          villages and temples, or the ruins of Hampi.

          In the 16th century, Hampi rivalled Rome in splendour and the
          Vijayanagar empire controlled almost all of south India from here.
          After Muslim invasions, only the stone buildings and a ghost city
          remained. The ruins however are extensive, and are located amongst a
          spectacular landscape of boulders. Many of Hampi’s ruins, such as the
          Lotus Temple, the Royal Enclosure, the Elephant Stables, the Queen’s
          Bath, and the Vittala Temple, can be reached by road, but it is also
          well worth exploring on foot, or by bicycle, as this is a unique
          landscape, with a seemingly infinite number of atmospheric ruins
          scattered throughout a huge area.

Hampi was once a huge capital city in the Vijaynagara Empire, larger at that time than Paris or London. Like Fatehpur Sikri in the north, it has been deserted for centuries, a ghost city of impressively carved ruins amid a boulder-strewn landscape. One of the most famous ruins is the massive stone carriage that is parked in front of an impressive gallery of decorated pillars, each sculpted from a single block of stone, and there are plenty of temples, pillars and other features to keep you busy exploring for days. With a laidback vibe, it’s also a great place to simply relax by the river. In the early mornings and late afternoons, the combination of gentle light and striking landscape gives Hampi a special ambience that defies description.
