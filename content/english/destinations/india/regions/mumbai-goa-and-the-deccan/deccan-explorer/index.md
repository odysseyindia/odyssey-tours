Day 1, Hyderabad
Your tour starts on arrival in Hyderabad airport, where you are met by our representative and transferred to your hotel. The twin city of Hyderabad-Secunderabad is a mixture of Muslim and Hindu cultures. Its history as the centre of Muslim India from the 16th century can best be appreciated at the massive Golconda Fort. This mighty hilltop fortress saw frequent battles and remains one of the most impressive in India. The old city is found around the famous Charminar gate, and this predominantly Muslim area is fascinating to explore.	
	
Suggested hotel: TAJ BANJARA
An old-fashioned business hotel with character. Built in 1949, the hotel offers spacious rooms with comfortable furnishings. The coffee shop and kebab restaurant serve South Indian and North Indian food specialities, with a particular emphasis on regional cuisine.



Day 2, Hyderabad

MORNING GUIDED CITY TOUR OF HYDERABAD
West of Hyderabad lies the historic Golconda Fort, with its massive battlements winding up the dust-brown hill. First built in the 13th century, this fort was rebuilt by the Qutab Shahis, who made it their capital in 1525, and laid out its splendid monuments and parks, and a famous acoustic system. Nearby are the domed tombs of seven Qutab Shahi kings, silently telling you of the splendor and grandeur of an era gone by.



Day 3, Gulbarga
Today, you have a fairly long drive, broken at Bidar, a pleasant town where one can visit abandoned 15th-century palaces, mosques and huge domed tombs, some of the finest examples of Muslim architecture in the Deccan. Bidar is still a centre of `Bidriware', in which beautiful flowing floral and 
arabesque patterns are inlaid and engraved on various objects. This technique was developed by Persian silversmiths, whose descendants can be seen at work in the old part of town.
 
GULBARGA
You continue to Gulbarga (or Kalaburagi) was the capital of the Bahmani dynasty. Later captured by the Adil Shahis and Mughals, it has remained a staunchly Muslim town. The most striking remains are the fort, with its citadel and mosque, the Jama Mashid (modelled on the great mosque of Cordoba), and its domed tomb, the Dargah of Bande Nawaz, the great Sufi saint and spiritual mentor of the Bahmani rulers. SIGHTSEEING??

Suggested hotel: CITRUS HOTEL GULBARGA BY OTHPL

	After breakfast, drive to Vijayapura (150kms, 03:30hrs). Stay in Kyriad Hotel Vijayapura by 
	OTHPL. 
	VIJAYAPURA
	Vijayapura (formerly Bijapur) boasts some of India's finest Muslim monuments, dating from the 15th to the 17th centuries 
	when Bijapur was the capital of the Adil Shahi kings. Most famous is the Golgumbaz, a.vast mausoleum topped with an 
	enormous dome, the second-largest in the world after St Peter's in the Vatican. The Jama Masjid and other examples of 
	Muslim architecture are scattered throughout this traditional, fascinating town.

	spaces.



Day 5, Badami
	After breakfast, drive to Badami (124kms, 03:00hrs). Stay in Krishna Heritage Hotel. 
	BADAMI
	The sleepy villages of Badami, Pattadakal and Aihole were once the capital cities of the Chalukyas, who ruled much of the 
	Deccan between the 4th and 8th centuries. They built an astonishing profusion of temples, many still beautifully 
preserved. At Badami there are many cave temples, with rock-cut sculptures of religious figures. This is a fascinating, little-visited area, definitely worth the effort in getting here.
	KRISHNA HERITAGE HOTEL
	Krishna Heritage is approximately ten minutes’ drive outside Badami. It offers spacious rooms, most with a balcony. The 
	bathrooms are equally large and feature both indoor and outdoor showers. There is a small swimming pool. The restaurant 
	has a good choice of Indian and Chinese food. Wifi is free and available in the reception.
	


Day 6, Hampi
	After breakfast, drive to Hampi via Pattadakal and Aihole (160kms, 04:00hrs). Stay in Hampis 
	Boulders Resort. 
	PATTADAKAL
	Once a secondary capital of the Badami Chalukyas, this tiny village is now lost in the countryside but still famous for its 
	finely carved Hindu and Jain temples, which are collectively a World Heritage Site. Pattadakal has a group of monuments 
	consisting of 10 temples on the banks of the river Malaprabha representing early Chalukyan architecture. The detailed 
	descriptions in the sculptures of the temples give an insight into the social life of those days.
	AIHOLE
	Aihole is a small village near Badami, surrounded by small hillocks and scattered rock cut shrines. However, in the 5th 
	century, Aihole was the capital of Chalukya Kingdome, beaming with intelligentsia. People travelled from far flung places 
	to learn the science as well as the art of temple building in Aihole. The education of temple building began as early as the 
	5th century and continued till 12th century. A visit to the temples thar remain gives a glimpse on how temple architecture 
	evolved over the centuries. 
	


HAMPI
	Hampi was the capital of the Vijayanagar empire from 1336 to 1565. The city was well planned, with an efficient sewage 
	system, a bustling marketplace full of luxurious goods, and countless palaces and temples. Today, the extensive ruins at 
	Hampi tell a mysterious story about a bygone civilization. The landscape is remarkable, with miles and miles of granite 
	boulders and huge rock formations standing against the blue skies. 
	
Suggested hotel: HAMPI'S BOULDERS RESORT
This quirky resort is located a half-hour drive from Hampi's main sights, amidst a stunning location: you actually drive over large boulders to reach it! Spread over a large area leading down to the river, this is a unique place to stay. This private and remote resort is surrounded by nature, amid amid bamboo trees, coconut groves, mango trees, and the huge boulders that Hampi is famous for.


Day 7, Hampi

FULL DAY SIGHTSEEING OF HAMPI
In the 16th century, Hampi rivalled Rome in splendour and the Vijayanagar empire controlled almost all of south India from here. After Muslim invasions, only the stone buildings and a ghost city remained. The ruins however are extensive, and are located amongst a spectacular landscape of boulders. Many of Hampi's ruins, such as the Lotus Temple, the Royal Enclosure, the Elephant Stables, the Queen's Bath, and the Vittala Temple, can be reached by road, but it is also well worth exploring on foot, or by bicycle, as this is a unique landscape, with a seemingly infinite number of atmospheric ruins scattered throughout a huge area.



Day 8, Hampi
Today, you have a full day at leisure to explore Hampi on your own.	



Day 9, Chikmagalur
Today, you leave behind the Deccan's plains for the lovely hills of the Western Ghats range. It does take a while, though: you have an eight-drive drive, getting increasingly prettier, before you reach 
Chikmagalur. This is a calm, serene town surrounded by scenic hills, valleys, streams and coffee plantations. Nestled in the Baba Budan hills, where coffee was first introduced into India, Chikmagalur is great for outdoor activities, and also provides a convenient base from which to explore the historical sites of Belur, Halebid, and Shravanabelagola.

Suggested hotel: FLAMEBACK LODGES
In a picturesque coffee plantation is Flameback, a collection of cottages and villas separated by lush forest. Built to let you enjoy nature, the villas and suites have wide decks, jacuzzis and great views, and you have plenty of active options, from walking trails to birding, ATVs, jeeps, and local treks. Or you can simply enjoy the resort's pool, spa and great food, all in the midst of nature.



Day 10, Chikmagalur

DAY AT LEISURE AT FLAMEBACK LODGES
Book a massage or relax in the Jacuzzi in the tranquil Robusta Spa. There are also two steam baths and invigorating ice showers. The swimming pool has spectacular views across the paddy fields to the Western Ghats. If you are more energetic, you can do a guided trek through the coffee estate with its abundant birdlife or do a workout in the secluded, well-equipped gym with sweeping views over the coffee and cardamom estate.



Day 11, Mysore
Today, you drive to Mysore via the old Hoysala capitals of Belur and Halebid, stuffed with amazing temples. 

Belur's Chennakesava temple, still in use, is a fine example of the singular Hoysala style. It took 103 years to complete, with intricate sculptures outside and awe-inspiring filigreed pillars within. The Veeranarayana Temple and the smaller shrines are also worth a visit.

The tiny hamlet of Halebid was, believe it or not, a royal capital for two centuries. The main attraction today is the Hoysaleshvara temple: this has a wealth of sculptural detail, the walls covered with gods, goddesses, animals and dancing girls. No two facets of the temple are alike. Guarded by a Nandi Bull, it was never completed, despite 86 years of work.

The entire drive to Mysore should take about five to six hours, depending on how long you spend at each stop. 

Suggested hotel: ROYAL ORCHID METROPOLE HOTEL
This hotel was originally built by the Wodeyar ruling family of Mysore, and has considerable old-world charm. Built to house the Maharaja's British guests, the building consists of rooms that still bear graceful writing desks, claw-foot bathtubs and winged armchairs. There's also a very pleasant pool area, and a nice courtyard with seating under majestic old trees, and a coffee shop, plus an atmospheric bar.



Day 12, Mysore
Mysore (or Mysuru) is a friendly and easy-going city with a pleasant climate. With a number of beautiful palaces and pre-Independence architecture, Mysore has a faded grandeur and small-town charm. The city is a crafts centre, and has numerous shops selling a wide range of sandalwood, rosewood and teak carvings, furniture, traditional Mysore silk, puppets and lacquer-ware and other handicrafts.

MORNING GUIDED TOUR OF MYSORE
The focal point of the city is the 19th-century Maharaja's Palace. Part of it is still used by the royal family on festive occasions; the other part is a museum. The collection, which includes a golden howdah (elephant saddle) that kings used during processions, gives a taste of the splendid lifestyle of the Wodeyar rulers of Mysore. 

The Wodeyars were devoted to the goddess Chamundesvari, enshrined on Chamundi Hill (13km away). Half way up the hill is a gigantic monolithic Nandi Bull, about 5m high. There is also a 12th-century temple dedicated to the goddess.


The afternoon is at leisure.
	


Day 13, Bangalore
After breakfast, you drive four hours to Bangalore, the Silicon Valley of India. This buzzing city has beautiful parks, avenues and impressive buildings. Parts of the city are amongst the most modern and Westernised areas of India, replete with shopping malls, microbreweries, bars and restaurants.

Suggested hotel: ST. MARKS HOTEL
St. Mark's Hotel, in the heart of Bangalore, is a 4-star boutique hotel, close to Brigade Road, and to several tourist attractions and shopping centres. A pleasant, modern hotel, St Mark’s has an airy feel, and has an indoor dining option known for its Indian food. The rooms are well made and comfortable - perfect after or before a long flight.
