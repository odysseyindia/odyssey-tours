          Aurangabad, named after the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb, is the gateway
          to the World Heritage Sites of Ajanta and Ellora. These complexes of
          caves are superb examples of rock cut architecture. Also worth
          visiting are the Bibi ka Maqbara, built to rival the Taj Mahal, and
          the magnificent hilltop fortress of Daulatabad.

          Built by Aurangzeb’s son as a mausoleum to his mother, the
          Bibi-Ka-Maqbara is the finest example of Mughal architecture in the
          Deccan plateau. Modelled on the Taj Mahal, it is about half its size.
          Panchakki is a 17th-century water mill, famous for its underground
          water channel. The Aurangabad Caves, hacked into a high hillside
          cleft, are a World Heritage Site from the Buddhist era.

          The Ajanta caves reflect the peak of ancient Indian art and
          architecture. The caves were cut in rocky cliffs above a
          horseshoe-shaped valley to provide prayer halls and a place of
          residence for Buddhist monks. Craftsmen cut out the rock and sculpted
          it while others made beautiful murals depicting places, royalty,
          culture and tales of everyday life in ancient India.

          Artists worked at the cave site of Ellora, 30km from Aurangabad, from
          about 600 to 1000 A.D. They created Buddhist, Hindu, and Jain caves
          next to each other. The masterpiece at Ellora is the astonishing
          temple dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva. It is the world’s largest
          monolithic sculpture, carved out of one single rock cliff by 7,000
          labourers over 150 years.
