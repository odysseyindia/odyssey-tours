          A short boat ride from the busy port city of Karwar gets you to this
          lovely retreat, with its airy cottages and total seclusion. The cabins
          are all spacious, and all offer views of the sea. There is an infinity
          pool, a restaurant, a casual bar and a lounge with a library, as if
          having an island largely to yourself wasn’t enough. A very different
          side to India, and a great end to a trip.

An astonishing thing: a completely private island in bustling India! At this private island in the Arabian Sea, just off the coast of Karnataka, you can go on and vegetate, or take part in a whole host of activities. You’ll love the comfortable cabins, the stunning views, and most of all, the seclusion. A very different side to India, and a great end to a trip.
