        content: >-
          The capital of the state of Orissa, Bhubaneswar, is a fast expanding
          city offering a real contrast between the modern new buildings and
          hundreds of old temples.


          The most famous here is the Lingaraj Temple. Only Hindus can enter
          this temple, but there are plenty of others nearby which can be easily
          visited. There are also interesting caves nearby.

          This old-fashioned but comfortable hotel is in an ideal location in
          the center of the city, close to the airport and railway station, with
          interesting markets nearby. The rooms are spacious and modern.


          There is a mosaic-tile swimming pool, a large restaurant with an
          extensive menu of Indian dishes, a smaller one specializing in
          continental food, a pastry shop/café, and a bar.

          The lively old city of Bhubanehwar is full of ancient temples. The
          most famous, the Lingaraj Temple, is closed to non-Hindus, but can be
          observed from a raised platform opposite.


          It is possible to visit a number of temples located around Bindu
          Sarovar, a tank which is believed to receive water from all the holy
          rivers of India. The Mukteshwar temple, with its famous stone arch at
          the entrance, known as the gem of Orissan architecture, is full of
          sculptures on the outer walls depicting the famous folk tales of the
          Panchatantra.


          The nearby Udaygiri and Khandagiri caves feature ornate temples and
          shrines carved within the rocks in the 1st century BC.


          Your afternoon is at leisure.

          After breakfast, you drive two hours into Orissa’s interior, to the
          busy market town of Dhenkanal. For 12 days every year, following the
          Dusshera festival, it is taken over by a large and colourful festival,
          during which elaborately decorated shrines to the goddess Laxmi draw
          huge crowds. On the final day of the festival the shrines are loaded
          onto trucks and a huge, noisy, colourful, parade of dancers and
          musicians travels slowly around the town.

          The rambling old palace overlooking the town of Dhenkanal is
          wonderfully atmospheric. The rooms are scattered throughout the
          building, all with different décor and features. The whole place is
          filled with antiques, and there are several comfortable lounges in
          which to soak in the history.


          Time can be spent relaxing on the lawns, maybe in conversation with
          the erstwhile rulers of Dhenakanal, who still reside in the palace.

          In the morning, you visit fascinating handicrafts villages near
          Dhenkanal. At Nuapatna most homes are dedicated to saree weaving. At
          Saptasajya, you can see the process of turning wax into brass
          ornaments.


          You return to Dhenkanal Palace for lunch, and head out again to
          Joranda, for the evening puja performed by monks of the Mahima
          movement, who live a simple life of abstinence and meditation, a
          moving and unique experience.

        title: Puri
        content: >-
          After breakfast, you drive to a major highlight: the beach temples of
          Konarak. The splendid Sun temple of Konarak, built in the 13th
          century, is the finest example of ancient Orissan temple architecture.
          The temple was conceived in the form of a colossal chariot for the sun
          god Surya, standing on 12 pairs of eight-spoke-wheels and drawn by
          seven galloping horses.


          The horses represent the seven days of the week, the wheels the 24
          fortnights of the Indian year, and the eight spokes of each wheel the
          periods into which the ancients divided day and night. Every aspect of
          life has been carved on the facades of the temple. The most striking
          sculptures are the erotic figures locked in postures drawn from the
          Kama Sutra.


          You continue to Puri, a popular seaside resort, famous for the great
          ‘Car Festival’ held at the Temple of Jagannath in June or July. During
          this festival, the image of Jagannath is placed on an enormous
          15m-high wooden chariot and drawn through the streets by thousands of
          penitents. In times past, ecstatic pilgrims would hurl themselves
          under the wheels of this “juggernaut”. Throughout the year, the long
          sandy beach is a popular attraction.

          The Hans Coco Palms is a resort in the true sense of the word: with
          swaying fan shaped traveller’s palms catching the breeze from the
          nearby sea, and a dozen lounge chairs around an inviting swimming
          pool.


          Located at the quiet end of the long stretch of the Puri beach, it is
          close enough to the brightly-lit food stalls but far enough away for
          you to be able to truly enjoy its peacefulness. The large rooms are
          well appointed.

        content: >-
          The artists' village of Raghurajpur, close to Puri, is two streets of
          120 thatched brick houses adorned with murals of geometric patterns
          and mythological scenes, a traditional art form that has almost died
          out in Orissa.


          The village is most famous for its patachitra work, made using cloth
          coated with a mixture of gum and chalk made from tamarind seeds.
          Artists mark out animals, flowers, deities and demons, which are then
          illuminated with bright colours. Traditional Odiya dances such as
          Gotpua can be seen on arrangement.

        content: >-
          Your route back to Bhubaneswar today takes you first to placid Chilika
          Lake. A great shallow lagoon covering 1,100 sq km, Chilika is
          separated from the Bay of Bengal by a sandy ridge, with just a narrow
          channel connecting it to the sea. It is a beautiful, peaceful place to
          visit, especially from November to February, when the lake and its
          reed islands teem with nesting birds, including several winter
          migrants. These are best seen during a simple boat ride from
          Mangalajodi, on the northwestern shore.

Think you’ve seen India? Well, Orissa is still going to blow you away. Utterly rich in temples, beaches and untouched villages, it makes for a great, offbeat trip. Starting with the vibrant temples of Bhubaneswar, you carry on to the hidden-away Dhenkanal Palace, a great base to explore little villages and markets in the hinterland. Then, you visit the world-famous Sun Temple at Konark, and a sweet artisans' village, famous for its cloth paintings, and finally go on to the largest brackish-water lagoon in the world at Chilika, and look for exotic birds and incredibly rare dolphins and dugongs.
