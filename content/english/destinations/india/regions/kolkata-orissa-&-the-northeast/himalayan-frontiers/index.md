You go to Darjeeling to enjoy the atmosphere of the British Raj, the lush green tea plantations, the magnificent views of the Kanchenjunga and the colourful hill people of the Northeastern Himalayas. 

During the British Raj in India, Darjeeling's temperate climate led to its development as a hill station (hill town) for British residents to escape the heat of the plains during the summers, becoming known as the Summer Capital.

Nearby are the ruins of Rabdentse, the second capital of Sikkim, reached by a short path through the surrounding forests.

Day 6, Gangtok

EARLY MORNING HIKE TO SANGA CHOELING MONASTERY
Early in the morning, your guide will lead you on the 3km hike to Sanga Choeling Monastery, perched on top of a hill.

This is the oldest monastery in Sikkim, giving you magnificent views of the verdant foothills and the imposing mountains behind them.   

GANGTOK
After your hike and breakfast, you can rest on the five-hour drive to Gangtok, the capital of Sikkim. The mountainsides here are covered with orchids and vast forests of rhododendrons. Apart from the mountain scenery, the main attraction of Sikkim is its Buddhist monasteries. Sikkim is home to over 250 of these, and while some are deserted, most others like Rumtek are thriving centres of Buddhism. The evening is at leisure if you'd like to explore the pleasant pedestrianised centre of town.

They'll even bring you a cup of salted butter tea when it's served to the monks.

KALIMPONG
After this, you drive to the hillside town of Kalimpong. Before the Chinese takeover of Tibet, Kalimpong was the centre of India's wool trade with that country, with Tibetan caravans winding their way down from the Tibetan plateau to trade wool for manufactured goods. Even today, Kalimpong is home to diverse communities, and a short walk reveals temples, monasteries, churches and mosques. Kalimpong is also a centre for bird watching, hikes, and world-famous flower nurseries.
