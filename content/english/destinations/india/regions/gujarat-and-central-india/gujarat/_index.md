          Ahmedabad is the cultural capital of Gujarat and a major textile and
          crafts centre. The city is packed with diverse architectural styles,
          with over fifty mosques and tombs, as well as Hindu and Jain temples
          and grand, beautifully-carved step-wells. The old part of town is a
          maze of narrow winding alleys with carved wooden house-fronts and
          thriving bazaars.

          The House of MG is a bastion of tranquility and early 20th-century
          charm against the swirling noise and colour of modern-day Ahmedabad.
          It has beautifully decorated rooms and a wonderful ambience. Located
          in the heart of the city, the House of MG is also the home to the
          perennially popular Agashiye, a rooftop restaurant that serves
          delicious traditional Gujarati food.

          group walk through the narrow lanes of the historic Old City of
          Ahmeadbad. This is a fascinating maze of crowded bazaars, residential
          areas and subterranean stepwells. At the end of the 2-hour walk, you
          return to the hotel for a late breakfast.

          Alongside the Sabaramati River, the Ashram was the home of Mahatma
          Gandhi from 1915 to 1930, and the seeds of India’s Independence
          campaign were sown here. His simple living quarters are maintained
          exactly as they were at that time. There is also a museum dedicated to
          his life.


          The nearby Law Garden Market operates from late afternoon and has
          stalls selling colourful local fabrics, as well as a “food street”
          with local fast food outlets - the kulfi falooda is highly recommended
          at the end of a hot day.

          Dasada and its nearby villages are inhabited by a number of
          interesting communities including pastoral groups. The women of the
          Kharapat Rabari community do exquisite embroidery using herringbone
          stitches interspersed with small mirrors, and chain stitches for
          peacocks and other motifs. An interesting weaving method here is Ikat,
          which involves the continual resist drying of the warp threads before
          drawing them on the loom.

          the capital of the province, known for its congregation of textile
          weavers and designers. The now deserted palace buildings of the Aina
          Mahal and Prag Mahal have an eerie beauty. Bhuj is the perfect base
          for visiting villages in Kutch, where the tribal people turn out
          exquisite hand-loomed woollen and cotton clothes decorated with dye or

          In the villages around Bhuj, the tribal people turn out exquisite
          handloomed woollen and cotton clothes decorated with dye or
          embroidery, often with mirrorwork.


          The small village of Bhujodi, 10km from Bhuj, is home to the Rabari or
          local cattle-herding community. There are 250 families in the village
          and all of them are weavers. Women manufacture the yarn while the men
          work on the handlooms. You can visit the artisans in their homes to
          see the process for weaving from buying cotton to making thread and
          weaving it on loom.


          The nearby village of Ajrakhpur is home of the traditional Ajrakh
          block printing style that uses natural dyes made from turmeric,
          pomegranate, ink and mud to create endless yards of fabric. The
          printing blocks are often shaped and carved by hand using absolute
          precision and skill. Almost every family in the village contributes to
          this complex art form in some way. Ajrakhpur has also a wonderful
          ‘Living and Learning Design Center’.


          A little further is Dhaneti village where you can see the embroidery
          skills of the Ahir community. Ahir embroidery is known for its
          prolific use of mirrors, floral designs, parrots and peacocks. Each
          stitch and motif has a specific name. They tend to use a variety of
          base fabrics. These include tie-dye bandhani fabrics in reds and
          oranges, and satin weave mashru that has a silky feel.

          Not far north of Bhuj is a village called Zura where Huser Sidhik and
          his family keep alive the art of copper-bell making. Made from scrap
          metal, the copper is moulded and crafted into bells of all shapes and
          sizes. No two bells are alike in their chimes, which is truly
          remarkable.


          A few kilometres from Zura is the village of Nirona where the delicate
          art form known as Rogan Art originated. The technique, which was
          traditionally used to adorn bridal wear, involves dipping a metal
          needle in vibrant oil-based paints to create designs on fabric.


          Further north is the small village of Bhirandiyara, known for its fine
          embroidery work. While the women create fascinating designs of
          clothes, bed sheets, wall hangings, table cloths, jewellery, toys,
          hand bags and more, the men create all sorts of leather products. The
          diminishing craft of Khavda pottery is still practiced by a handful of
          artisanal communities in this northern Kutch village. While the men do
          the throwing of the terracotta, the women are in charge of the surface
          decoration.


          The village of Hodka has picturesque thatched-roofed mud huts known as
          Bhungas, with hand-painted exterior walls and interior walls adorned
          with mud-mirror work. The leather bags and quilts of the village are
          especially popular, known for their colourful hues and fine
          embroidery.

          Today, you drive for six hours to the princely state of Gondal, known
          for its progressive rulers. In the late 19th century, Gondal did away
          with the women’s purdah or veil, abolished land taxes and insisted on
          education for girls. Gondal is an interesting city with some
          finely-carved palaces. The town is also home to an interesting
          100-year-old ayurvedic pharmacy.


          You stay in Orchard Palace, originally built to house the guests of
          the Maharaja of Gondal.

          in the reserve is the Kamleshwar Dam, known for its large crocodile
          population. Originally protected by the Nawab of Junagadh, the
          Sasangir Forest is the last remaining sanctuary of the Asiatic lion.

          A typical small princely state, Sayla consists of a palace, and a
          cluster of villages, which were centres for cottage industry. The
          women of the Kathi community specialize in beadwork, the craft of
          attaching beads with one another to create beautiful jewellery, whilst
          the men specialize in single Ikat weaving. Sayla is also a centre for
          khadi, cotton fabrics made from hand spun thread and woven on a
          handloom. Khadi is promoted as a source of self-reliance and in the
          past it helped shape the movement for India’s independence, being
          particularly linked with Mahatma Gandhi.

Though not completely unknown, Gujarat is so culturally rich you wonder why more people don&rsquo;t visit it! Extremely varied, it goes from Ahmedabad&rsquo;s bustling lanes to vast carved monuments to the endless salt plains of Kutch, a lovely palace built by a feminist ruler in Gondal, (literally) breathtaking temples at Palitana, and the Asiatic lion in Sasangir forest. You get to meet locals and explore the beautiful mirror-work embroidery, look for amazing wildlife including birds, desert foxes, hyenas, the very rare Wild Ass and of course lions, and try great food on this offbeat trip.
