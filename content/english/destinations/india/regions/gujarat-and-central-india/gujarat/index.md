description: "Though not completely unknown, Gujarat is so culturally rich you wonder why more people don't visit it! Extremely varied, it goes from Ahmedabad's bustling lanes to vast carved monuments to the endless salt plains of Kutch, a lovely palace built by a feminist ruler in Gondal, (literally) breathtaking temples at Palitana, and the Asiatic lion in Sasangir forest. You get to meet locals and explore the beautiful mirror-work embroidery, look for amazing wildlife including birds, desert foxes, hyenas, the very rare Wild Ass and of course lions, and try great food on this offbeat trip."

Day 1, Ahmedabad
Your tour starts on arrival at Kolkata airport, where you are met by our representative and transferred to your hotel. Ahmedabad is the cultural capital of Gujarat and a major textile and crafts centre. The city is packed with diverse architectural styles, with over fifty mosques and tombs, as well as Hindu and Jain temples and grand, beautifully-carved step-wells. The old part of town is a maze of narrow winding alleys with carved wooden house-fronts and thriving bazaars.

Suggested hotel: THE HOUSE OF MANGALDAS GIRDHARDAS
The House of MG is a bastion of tranquility and early 20th-century charm against the swirling noise and colour of modern-day Ahmedabad. It has beautifully decorated rooms and a wonderful ambience. Located in the heart of the city, the House of MG is also the home to the perennially popular Agashiye, a rooftop restaurant that serves delicious traditional Gujarati food.


Day 2, Ahmedabad

EARLY MORNING HERITAGE WALK OF AHMEDABAD
You join a morning guided group walk through the narrow atmospheric lanes of the historic Old City. This is a fascinating maze of crowded bazaars, exquisitely carved facades, temples, subterranean stepwells, and even a secret passageway. You first walk through a Hindu-dominated area, then a section dominated by Jains, then finally to the Muslim market area to end at the city's largest mosque.
	
AFTERNOON VISIT TO GANDHI'S SABARMATI ASHRAM & LAW GARDEN MARKET
Alongside the Sabarmati River, the Ashram was the home of Mahatma Gandhi from 1915 to 1930, and the seeds of India's Independence campaign were sown here. His simple living quarters are maintained exactly as they were at that time. There is also a museum dedicated to his life.   

The nearby Law Garden Market operates from late afternoon and has stalls selling colourful local fabrics, as well as a "food street" with local fast food outlets - the kulfi falooda is highly recommended at the end of a hot day. 



Day 3, Dasada
After breakfast, you drive out of Ahmedabad to the beautiful temples and step-wells of Patan, visit the workshops of the silk-saree weavers at Patola, and be awed by the Sun Temple of Modhera.

DASADA
You end the day at Dasada, a village on the outskirts of the Rann of Kutch, a vast salt marsh that spans 30,000 sq km. Dasada is the perfect base from which to explore the Rann of Kutch, the last refuge in India of the Asiatic wild ass, an elegant member of the horse family. In winter it is also home to 
migratory birds such as flamingoes, MacQueen's bustard etc.

Suggested hotel: RANN RIDERS
Rann Riders is a resort featuring different types of traditional Gujarati and tribal homes set around well-kept lawns and shady trees. These mud, stone and tiled cottages are all furnished with modern comforts while preserving the essential rural feel of the homes. This eco-friendly resort is a good base from which to explore the salt plains and wetlands that form the Rann of Kutch.



Day 4, Dasada

MORNING WILDLIFE SAFARI IN THE LITTLE RANN OF KUTCH
A shared jeep safari across the Little Rann of Kutch, a vast expanse of salt flats and grasslands. This unique ecosystem supports a variety of wildlife including the Asiatic wild ass, found only here. The wild ass is a handsome chestnut-brown member of the horse family. Capable of reaching high speeds, the wild ass is usually seen in small herds. The elegant blackbuck, nilgai and the graceful chinkara are also seen in the Rann.

AFTERNOON VILLAGE SAFARI
Dasada and its nearby villages are inhabited by a number of interesting communities including pastoral groups. The women of the Kharapat Rabari community do exquisite embroidery using herringbone stitches interspersed with small mirrors, and chain stitches for peacocks and other motifs. An interesting weaving method here is Ikat, which involves the continual resist drying of the warp threads before drawing them on the loom.



Day 5, Bhuj
After breakfast, you have a six-hour drive across arid Kutch to Bhuj, the capital of the province, known for its congregation of textile weavers and designers. The now deserted palace buildings of the Aina Mahal and Prag Mahal have an eerie beauty. Bhuj is the perfect base for visiting villages in Kutch, where the tribal people turn out exquisite hand-loomed woollen and cotton clothes decorated with dye or embroidery.
	
Suggested hotel: THE BHUJ HOUSE
The Bhuj House is a traditional Parsi courtyard house in the historic town of Bhuj. Built in the late 1800s, it has stood through seven generations of the Bhujwala family, and survived the devastating Bhuj earthquake of 2001. The family have lovingly restored the house, opening it as a delightful four-room heritage homestay.



Day 6, Bhuj

FULL-DAY EXCURSION TO BHUJODI, AJRAKPUR AND DHANETI VILLAGES
In the villages around Bhuj, the tribal people turn out exquisite hand-loomed woollen and cotton clothes decorated with dye or embroidery, often with mirrorwork.
 
The small village of Bhujodi, 10km from Bhuj, is home to the Rabari or local cattle-herding community. There are 250 families in the village, all weavers. Women manufacture the yarn while the men work on the handlooms. You can visit the artisans in their homes to see the process for weaving from buying cotton to making thread and weaving it on loom.

The nearby village of Ajrakhpur is home of the traditional Ajrakh block printing style that uses natural dyes made from turmeric, pomegranate, ink and mud to create endless yards of fabric. The printing blocks are often shaped and carved by hand using absolute precision and skill. Almost every family in the village contributes to this complex art form in some way. Ajrakhpur has also a wonderful `Living and Learning Design Center’.

A little further is Dhaneti village, where you can see the embroidery skills of the Ahir community. Ahir embroidery is known for its prolific use of mirrors, floral designs, parrots and peacocks. Each stitch and motif has a specific name. They tend to use a variety of base fabrics. These include tie-dye bandhani fabrics in reds and oranges, and satin weave mashru, which has a silky feel.


Day 7, Bhuj

FULL DAY EXCURSION TO HODKA AND OTHER TEXTILE VILLAGES NORTH OF BHUJ
Not far north of Bhuj is a village called Zura where Huser Sidhik and his family keep alive the art of copper-bell making. Made from scrap metal, the copper is moulded and crafted into bells of all shapes and sizes. No two bells are alike in their chimes, which is truly remarkable.  

A few kilometres from Zura is the village of Nirona where the delicate art form known as rogan originated. The technique, which was traditionally used to adorn bridal wear, involves dipping a metal needle in vibrant oil-based paints to create designs on fabric.  

Further north is the small village of Bhirandiyara, known for its fine embroidery work. While the women create fascinating designs of clothes, bed sheets, wall hangings, table cloths, jewellery, toys, hand bags and more, the men create all sorts of leather products. The diminishing craft of khavda pottery is still practiced by a handful of artisanal communities in this northern Kutch village. While the men do the throwing of the terracotta, the women are in charge of the surface decoration.  

The village of Hodka has picturesque thatched-roofed mud huts known as bhungas, with hand-painted exterior walls and interior walls adorned with mud-mirror work. The leather bags and quilts of the village are especially popular, known for their colourful hues and fine embroidery.


Day 8, Gondal
Today, you drive for six hours to the princely state of Gondal, known for its progressive rulers. In the late 19th century, Gondal did away with the women's purdah or veil, abolished land taxes and insisted on education for girls. Gondal is an interesting city with some finely-carved palaces. The town is also home to an interesting 100-year-old ayurvedic pharmacy. 

You stay in Orchard Palace, originally built to house the guests of the Maharaja of Gondal.

Suggested hotel: ORCHARD PALACE
A lovely palace with just seven guest rooms, set in a huge complex of fruit orchards, lawns and gardens. A delightful accommodation option is the beautifully restored Rail Saloon of the royal family! The "room of miniatures" is a splendid sitting room with a collection of miniature paintings, brass and antique furniture. The vast property also includes an impressive collection of classic and vintage cars.
	


Day 9, Sasangir
Today, you drive four hours to Sasan Gir, and with any luck, you'll get to see lions! Sasangir is the only habitat of the lion left outside Africa, and with the lion population 300-strong, your chances of spotting one are very good. Other wildlife includes panthers, hyenas, foxes, wild boar, sambhar, and nilgai. There is also rich bird life including the rare paradise flycatcher. Just outside the sanctuary entrance is a crocodile hatchery.

JEEP SAFARI INTO SASANGIR NATIONAL PARK
Gir National Park & Wildlife Sanctuary is a hilly tract of dry deciduous forests, acacia scrub, evergreen and semi-evergreen flora and grasslands, fed by rivers and streams. Among the many water-bodies in the reserve is the Kamleshwar Dam, known for its large crocodile population. Originally protected by the Nawab of Junagadh, the Sasangir Forest is the last remaining sanctuary of the Asiatic lion. 


Suggested hotel: GIR BIRDING LODGE
The coffee-coloured cottages of the Gir Birding Lodge are set in a rambling mango orchard that merges with the deciduous forests of the Gir Wildlife Sanctuary beyond. These tastefully-furnished cottages have been built to ensure privacy whilst still offering unrestricted views over the trees and fields that attract their own share of birdlife. The Gir Birding Lodge offers a good base for tracking the Asiatic lion in the wild.
	
	
Day 10, Diu
You drive today to Gujarat's coast today, a four-hour drive taking you to the former Portuguese colony of Diu. To this day, it retains a distinctive atmosphere. The town of Diu is a maze of narrow, winding streets and many of the houses are well ornamented and brightly painted. There are many interesting churches and a huge 16th- century fort built in Portuguese style. Nearby is a beautiful sandy beach at Ahmedpur Mandvi.

The rest of the day is free for you to enjoy a relaxed time at the beach.

Suggested hotel: RADHIKA BEACH RESORT
With double-storied tile-roofed villas surrounding a paved garden and swimming pool, this is generally considered the best hotel in Diu. It is located on Diu's best beach - Nagoa. The rooms are spacious and imaginatively done up. Radhika Beach Resort also features a swimming pool, health club and indoor games.



Day 11, Palitana
A five-hour drive takes you to the small but fascinating town of Palitana. Shatrunjay Hill in Palitana is the holiest place on Earth in Jainism, a belief system that revolves around non-violence toward all living things - people, animals, even insects. This temple city is the largest of its kind in India. The 863 temples date from the 11th to the 16th century and are dedicated to the 24 different gods worshipped in the Jain religion.  

You can relax on this afternoon at your palace hotel, and visit the temples early the next day.

Suggested hotel: VIJAY VILAS PALACE
Vijay Vilas Palace is a charming heritage home-stay in the shadow of Shatrunjay Hill. The palace has been tastefully decorated with delicate Victorian furniture and warm colours. This quaint, 100-year-old property was built by the local Maharaja; his descendants, Mr. Yashpal Singh and his wife are available for long conversations, while you savour the peace of the countryside and sample the exquisite home-cooked food.



Day 12, Palitana

EARLY MORNING HIKE TO THE PALITANA TEMPLES
The Palitana temples are on top of Shatrunjay hill. The winding 3.5-km path to the top has 3,950 steps and you can do this on your own without a guide. There's also a thriving local industry of people who will carry you up the steps in baskets, or even literally push you up the steps! The reward for the climb is a superb view and the extraordinary temples themselves.

The remainder of the day is at leisure to catch your breath.



Day 13, Sayla
After breakfast, drive to the princely state of Sayla, which takes about four hours. The village of Sayla, southwest of Ahmedabad, has historic buildings, old houses, temples, ashrams, lake, weavers and handicrafts. 

AFTERNOON VISIT TO SAYLA'S TEXTILE CENTRES
A typical small princely state, Sayla consists of a palace, and a cluster of villages, which were centres for cottage industry. The women of the Kathi community specialize in beadwork, the craft of attaching beads with one another to create beautiful jewellery, whilst the men specialize in single Ikat weaving. Sayla is also a centre for khadi, cotton fabrics made from hand spun thread and woven on a handloom. Khadi is promoted as a source of self-reliance and in the past it helped shape the movement for India’s independence, being particularly linked with Mahatma Gandhi.


BELL GUEST HOUSE
The Bell Guest House is an Indo-European building that once hosted European visitors to the Sayla princely state. Set in lush green gardens with shady trees and lawns, this house has now been renovated and opened as a heritage homestay offering the personalized hospitality of the erstwhile Yuvraj and Yuvrani of Sayla. An ideal place to kick back and relax, with high-ceilinged rooms, pleasant grounds and a colonnaded verandah. 


Day 14, Ahmedabad
Today, you drive the three hours to Ahmedabad's airport to connect with your onward flight.
