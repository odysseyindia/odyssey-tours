title: Hidden India
subtitle: Ahmedabad, Balasinor, Santrampur, Barnagar, Bhopal, Gwalior, Dholpur 
description: "A trip through one of the most fascinating, yet most easily overlooked belts of India. Starting in the culturally rich city of Ahmedabad, visiting Mahatma Gandhi's Sabarmati Ashram, you go on to two royal stays, one a charming garden palace by a park containing amazing dinosaur fossils, and the other a completely hidden and beautifully decorated palace by the lake in Santrampur. You carry on to tiny Barnagar, to a castle that feels like it dropped out of history, and then to the utterly surprising Bhopal, a city of great culture, to stay in a lovely palace and explore prehistoric caves and soothing Buddhist sites. You then travel along the river Chambal to Gwalior's huge fort and end at serene Dholpur's castle, a great base to look for birds and endangered crocodiles on the water. A stirring, offbeat trip."

Day 1, Ahmedabad
Your tour starts on arrival at Kolkata airport, where you are met by our representative and transferred to your hotel. Ahmedabad is the cultural capital of Gujarat and a major textile and crafts centre. The city is packed with diverse architectural styles, with over fifty mosques and tombs, as well as Hindu and Jain temples and grand, beautifully-carved step-wells. The old part of town is a maze of narrow winding alleys with carved wooden house-fronts and thriving bazaars.

Suggested hotel: THE HOUSE OF MANGALDAS GIRDHARDAS
The House of MG is a bastion of tranquility and early 20th-century charm against the swirling noise and colour of modern-day Ahmedabad. It has beautifully decorated rooms and a wonderful ambience. Located in the heart of the city, the House of MG is also the home to the perennially popular Agashiye, a rooftop restaurant that serves delicious traditional Gujarati food.


Day 2, Ahmedabad

EARLY MORNING HERITAGE WALK OF AHMEDABAD
You join a morning guided group walk through the narrow atmospheric lanes of the historic Old City. This is a fascinating maze of crowded bazaars, exquisitely carved facades, temples, subterranean stepwells, and even a secret passageway. You first walk through a Hindu-dominated area, then a section dominated by Jains, then finally to the Muslim market area to end at the city's largest mosque.
	
AFTERNOON VISIT TO GANDHI'S SABARMATI ASHRAM & LAW GARDEN MARKET
Alongside the Sabarmati River, the Ashram was the home of Mahatma Gandhi from 1915 to 1930, and the seeds of India's Independence campaign were sown here. His simple living quarters are maintained exactly as they were at that time. There is also a museum dedicated to his life.      

The nearby Law Garden Market operates from late afternoon and has stalls selling colourful local fabrics, as well as a "food street" with local fast food outlets - the kulfi falooda is highly recommended at the end of a hot day.

 
Day 3, Balasinor
After breakfast, you drive two hours east to Balasinor, home to the charming Garden Palace, built in 1883 and now run as a heritage hotel by the present Nawab. Balasinor is just 25km away from the prehistoric site of Raiyoli, India's Jurassic Park, where the fossilized bones and eggs of dinosaurs can be seen.

A visit to the park and other activities like a light hike can be booked directly at the hotel.

Suggested hotel: GARDEN PALACE
A charming 19th-century mansion in a lovely garden setting. The drawing room has original French furniture amongst other bric-a-brac, giving it a wonderfully period feel. The Nawabs of Balasinor were known for their hospitality, with kitchens famous for their distinctive Nawabi cuisine, and this is a great place to actually spend time with royalty in their own home.



Day 4, Santrampur
A two-hour drive takes you to another hidden treasure. In the lap of the Aravalli Hills in Gujarat lies the untouched town of Santrampur, which is riddled with ancient palaces and striking temple ruins. Santrampur comprises two townships, Sant and Rampur. While Rampur is the commercial town or the ‘city centre’, Sant was reserved for the palaces. Santrampur and its neighbouring areas are predominantly inhabited by tribals.

Your afternoon is at leisure.

Suggested hotel: SHRI JORAVER VILAS
Shri Joravar Vilas Palace at Santrampur is a lakeside heritage getaway offering a gateway into the tribal areas of Gujarat. The palace was built in 1926 in Art Deco style. Five contemporary rooms and suites occupy the ground floor of the building, surrounding a magnificent central courtyard. Inside the suites and out, a confluence of royal aesthetics adorns the walls, the bathrooms, the tables, the door knockers, and the furniture.



Day 5, Santrampur

DAY AT LEISURE IN SANTRAMPUR
Stroll through the small town of Sant to see the majestic Raj Mahal and the Hawa Mahal, as well as ancient Hindu temples dating from the 11th to the 14th century. You can also enjoy a boat trip on the lake with an opportunity to spot migratory birds. Take a walk in the neighbouring forest to explore the local flora and fauna, or visit tribal homes and farms to experience the local culture, and have a picnic in the countryside nearby.



	

Day 6, Barnagar
You drive for about five hours into Madhya Pradesh, ending the day at the town of Barnagar. Just outside Barnagar is `Amla Heritage Village’, a quaint place that seems to be stuck in a time warp. Life here carries on as it must have for centuries, with the odd exception of an electrical flour mill. Amla has been ruled for generations by the family of Raghavendra Singh, who operates the Fort Amla heritage hotel.

Suggested stay: FORT AMLA
The Fort Amla hotel belongs to a family that can trace its lineage back to the 8th century. This sprawling building of wide sweeping arches and open courtyards houses simple, cosy rooms. Your host is a great source of stories about this traditional village, where he is the unofficial banker, court of appeal and general go-to man for anything the villagers need, just as in medieval times (including childbirth advice!). 



Day 7, Bhopal
Today, you have a five-hour drive ahead, broken at the holy city of Ujjain. Ujjain draws visitors mainly for its famous Hindu shrines and the ghats or stone steps that lead down to the Shipra River. Ujjain is one of the four sites to host the Kumbh Mela, the largest religious gathering in the world. Every 12 years, millions of Hindus come together to take a dip in the holy Shipra. However, Ujjain's ghats are worth visiting even when the Kumbh Mela isn't on, a mini Varanasi full of colour and history.

BHOPAL
You continue to Bhopal, the under-rated capital of Madhya Pradesh, a surprising mix of medieval Hindu and Islamic architecture, and modern town-planning. It is a fast-growing city situated on gently-rolling hills and around two man-made lakes. Bhopal is perfect for visiting the stupas and abandoned monasteries of Sanchi, one of the most important Buddhist sites, and the cave shrines of Udaigiri and prehistoric cave paintings of Bhimbetka.    

Suggested hotel: JEHAN NUMA PALACE HOTEL
Built in 1890 and set in 5 sprawling acres, Jehan Numa Palace Hotel is the beautifully-preserved erstwhile home of the rulers of Bhopal. The abundance of space has also allowed for airy rooms with large beds and stylish colonial furniture in dark wood. Unlike most city hotels, Jehan Numa boasts of wide balconies, open lawns, fountains and many inviting spots to relax and unwind after a day of sightseeing.


Day 8, Bhopal

MORNING EXCURSION TO BHIMBETIKA
Amongst the boulder-strewn landscape of the Vindhya mountains is a collection of 600 rock shelters dating back to the Neolithic Age. Visitors are allowed to venture into 15 of these rock shelters to see cave paintings in bold red, white and yellow depicting animals, hunts and the daily scenes in the lives of people during the Stone Age. UNESCO has acknowledged this treasure by giving World Cultural Heritage status.


AFTERNOON CITY TOUR OF BHOPAL
The Taj-ul-Masjid is one of India’s largest mosques, a huge pink building with massive minarets and domes. The Moti Masjid is architecturally akin to Delhi's Jama Masjid. Bharat Bhawan houses an impressive collection of rural and tribal arts, a modern art and crafts gallery, and more. The Museum of Man is an open-air museum of tribal life, with replicas of adivasi (aboriginal) houses, compounds and shrines spread over an entire hillock.
	


Day 9, Bhopal

FULL-DAY EXCURSION TO SANCHI & UDAIGIRI
Among the oldest surviving monuments of ancient India are the Buddhist stupas of Sanchi, standing dramatically atop a hill. The most famous stupa is encircled by a railing cut by four exquisitely-carved gateways facing the four directions of the compass. The carvings show a world of people and animals living together in happiness and plenty.

The Udaigiri Caves are famous for rock-cut Buddhist sanctuaries, carved into a sandstone hill.
	


Day 10, Gwalior
Your morning is at leisure around in the hotel's pleasant grounds (or to go out and try the city's gold-standard kebabs and biryani). An afternoon train takes you to small but extremely interesting Gwalior, under the looming 1,000-year-old fortress. The mighty Scindia family once ruled the state of Gwalior, one of the most highly regarded princely states of India, and the old town has their slightly over-the-top 19th-century Jai Vilas Palace. Part of the palace is the present Maharaja's residence; the other is now a museum.

Suggested hotel: TAJ USHA KIRAN PALACE
An understated and chic offering of the Taj Group of hotels, the Usha Kiran Palace was originally built in the 1930s to welcome the King and Queen of England. As you step into the manicured grounds it is clear that the palace is unique. Luxurious without being overpoweringly opulent, and sophisticated but not snobby, the Usha Kiran Palace will be a highlight of your visit to Gwalior.
	


Day 11, Gwalior
MORNING GUIDED TOUR OF GWALIOR
Gwalior Fort, made of sandstone, is a magnificent monument. Within its walls are interesting Jain and Hindu temples and ruined palaces. At the foot of the cliff is an interesting archeological museum and huge Jain sculptures, some up to 20m tall. The Jai Vilas Palace is home to the Scindia family, done in Italian, Tuscan and Corinthian styles. One part is now a museum, with an idiosyncratic collection of royal memorabilia.

Your afternoon is at leisure.



Day 12, Dholpur
A two-hour drive through small towns gets you to the peaceful royal city of Dholpur, at the eastern edge of Rajasthan on the border with Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. A unique feature of Dholpur is its closeness to the Chambal ravines of Madhya Pradesh, once famous for their bandits - and now for great birding and crocodile-spotting. You can explore the area by boat and by jeep.

AFTERNOON CHAMBAL BOAT SAFARI
The Chambal River remains one of north India's most pristine, home to the rare Ganges River dolphins. The other inhabitants include mugger and shy gharial crocodiles, turtles and many species of migratory birds from Siberia. Take a boat safari on the Chambal river, experiencing the magnificent ravines on one side of the bank and wildlife on the expanse of the river on the other.

Suggested hotel: RAJ NIWAS PALACE
The 19th-century Raj Niwas Palace in Dholpur was once home to generations of royals. The red sandstone palace has now been converted to a luxurious heritage hotel with spacious rooms, with decor going from Art Deco to opulently painted walls. Set in 13 acres of garden, the palace grounds are full of peacocks and bird life, and offer a serene base to explore the Chambal river and ravines.
	


Day 13, Agra
After breakfast, drive for just over an hour to home to possibly the most famous and beautiful building in the world: the Taj Mahal, built in the 17th century by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan as a tomb and memorial for his wife Mumtaz Mahal. Along the river Yamuna is the impressive Red Fort, the capital of the Mughal Empire during the 16th and 17th centuries.

AFTERNOON GUIDED TOUR OF AGRA'S OTHER MONUMENTS
Agra has much to offer besides the Taj Mahal, such as Agra Fort, a masterpiece of design and construction. You then visit Itimad-ud-Daulah's tomb - better known as the Baby Taj, which also features the same marble inlay work as the Taj Mahal. Finally you will visit Mehtab Bagh, a formally laid-out Mughal garden that offers stupendous views of the Taj Mahal, especially in the late afternoon.

Suggested hotel: THE CORAL TREE HOMESTAY
This six-room home-stay is just a short walk away from the entrance to the Taj Mahal. The bright, cheerful rooms, verandahs and garden are all decorated with interesting pieces of art. The well-travelled owners are keen to interact with their guests, and are full of ideas to help you to get the most out of your time in Agra.


	
Day 14, Delhi

EARLY MORNING VISIT ON YOUR OWN TO THE TAJ MAHAL 
The best time of day to appreciate this stunning monument is as soon as the Taj Mahal opens, when it is at its quietest and most serene. You can enjoy the gardens, the mausoleum and the mosque, without needing a professional guide. Don't miss the marble inlay work and the various vantage points offered throughout the peaceful gardens. Once you have taken it all in, you can return to your hotel for a late breakfast.

The rest of your day is at leisure. In the late afternoon, you will board an express train to Delhi.

Suggested hotel: THE METROPOLITAN HOTEL
Located close to Connaught Place, in the centre of New Delhi, this quiet, upmarket hotel has a fresh atmosphere with vivid, minimalist, stylish designs. The hotel has 3 restaurants including one serving authentic Japanese cuisine. There is a swimming pool, an excellent large spa, a fashion & lifestyle store and an art gallery.



Day 15, Delhi

Today, you have a departure transfer to the airport to board your onward flight.
