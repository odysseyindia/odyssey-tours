          through Panjim, where you discover feni, an olfactory overload of a
          liquor distilled from cashew fruit and palm sap, and hear stories
          about Goan cuisine, with its Portuguese, Indian and East African
          influences. This trail, more a cultural experience than a typical pub
          crawl, includes some of the most iconic places for Goan food, paired
          with the best feni and feni-based cocktails.
