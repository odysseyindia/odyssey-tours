          Port Blair, the capital of the Andaman & Nicobar Islands, lies on the
          east coast of South Andaman Island and is the main entry point to the
          islands. Ferry boats link Port Blair to outlying islands. These
          islands are ringed with fine white coral sand, and one only has to
          wade in knee-deep to enter an underwater world filled with a dazzling
          variety of fish and corals.

          Radhanagar Beach (Beach #7) was rated as the best beach in Asia by
          Time Magazine in 2004, and is still exceptionally beautiful today,
          with gorgeous, silky white sand backed by a forest that provides
          welcome shade, overlooking deep turquoise waters. Some stretches are
          good for swimming, and one can also find some with excellent coral
          reefs for perfect snorkeling experiences.

The beautiful Andaman Islands are one of the best diving spots in the world: clear turquoise waters, coral reefs and great biodiversity make it a truly special spot to leap in. However, with Asia’s best beach, mangrove forests and great eco-resorts, it’s also a fantastic place for a relaxing holiday for a non-diver who prefers excitement in the form of perfectly grilled shrimp and pina coladas! With plenty of easy activities and safe locations, it’s also a lovely family destination.
