          Your tour begins when you arrive at Port Blair airport, where you are
          met by our representative, who will take you to the ferry bound for
          Havelock Island. This journey over the turquoise Andaman waters takes
          less than 2 hours, after which you are met at the jetty and
          transferred to your hotel.


          Please note: you can take the ferry to Havelock Island as long as your
          flight lands in Port Blair by noon. Otherwise, you’ll need to stay a
          night in Port Blair and take the ferry the next morning. Never fear
          though, Port Blair is extremely interesting on its own, with the
          sinister Cellular Jail (a British-era hellhole for political
          prisoners) and other historical sights to explore.


          Radhanagar Beach (Beach #7) was rated as the best beach in Asia by
          Time Magazine in 2004, and is still exceptionally beautiful today,
          with gorgeous, silky white sand backed by a forest that provides
          welcome shade, overlooking deep turquoise waters. Some stretches are
          good for swimming, and one can also find some with excellent coral
          reefs for perfect snorkeling experiences.

          forest. A great spot for scuba diving, snorkelling, kayaking, jungle
          walks, or simply lazing about, with farm-to-table food, a spa and a
          lovely, relaxed ambience.

          Today, you transfer to the jetty to board the ferry to Port Blair. By
          the time you reach Port Blair it will probably be too late to catch an
          onward flight, so you need to stay overnight near Port Blair's
          airport.

The beautiful Andaman Islands are one of the best diving spots in the world: clear turquoise waters, coral reefs and great biodiversity make it a truly special spot to leap in. However, with Asia’s best beach, mangrove forests and great eco-resorts, it’s also a fantastic place for a relaxing holiday for a non-diver who prefers excitement in the form of perfectly grilled shrimp and pina coladas! With plenty of easy activities and safe locations, it’s also a lovely family destination.
