          Delhi is practically two cities: New Delhi, the capital of India, and
          medieval Old Delhi. The old city centres around the Red Fort, which
          contains opulent palaces and impressive public buildings. Nearby is
          the magnificent Jama Masjid, India’s largest mosque. In New Delhi you
          can find India Gate - a war memorial arch, the impressive Parliament
          Building and Rashtrapati Bhawan, the residence of the President.
          Towards the South are Qutab Minar and Humayun’s Tomb, both World
          Heritage Sites.

          Colonel’s Retreat is a very pleasant and homely guest house in the

          are comfortable and artistically furnished. Each floor boasts a lovely
          lounge area with comfortable sofas for relaxing, books to read and
          borrow, and computers. A private rooftop dining area gives you a
          lovely view of the city.

          New Delhi has a number of attractions, like Humayun’s Tomb, a
          sandstone mausoleum in the authentic Mughal style - the Taj Mahal,
          built much later, follows a similar style of architecture. Nearby you
          can see India Gate, the Parliament Buildings, the Lodhi Gardens, the
          Lotus Temple, the President’s House, and the Sikh temple, Gurudwara
          Bangla Sahib. However, Delhi is huge and traffic is usually heavy, and
          half a day is not enough to see all of the attractions, so it is best
          to discuss with your guide which sights you might wish to visit.

          Situated on the north-western border of India, in Punjab, the
          400-year-old city of the Golden Temple is the paramount seat of Sikh
          history and culture. More recently, it has also become known for the
          unique border-closing ceremony that takes place every evening at
          nearby Wagah, at the only open land border between India and Pakistan.

          Amritsar’s highlights are clustered in the attractive area around the
          Golden Temple. The Partition Museum in the historic Town Hall tells
          the story of India’s independence and the tragically violent division
          of India and Pakistan. Jallianwala Bagh is a garden dedicated to those
          massacred here by the British in 1919. The big draw is visiting the
          serene Golden Temple, capped by the communal, free meal offered to
          thousands every day.

          The daily border closing ceremony at the Wagah Border between India
          and Pakistan is extraordinary street theatre. Crowds assemble in large
          stands on both sides of the border, with much chanting, singing of
          patriotic songs, and even dancing, with a faux-aggressive ceremony.
          The event is choreographed, and the atmosphere is actually that of a
          big party!

          Dharamsala is a hill station that was established by the British in
          the mid-19th century. It stands on a spur of the Dhauladhar range
          amidst magnificent deodar and pine forests, tea gardens and beautiful
          hills. Today Upper Dharamsala, known as Mcleod Ganj, is the home of
          the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan Government-in-Exile. It is therefore
          the best base to explore Tibetan Buddhism, history and culture.

          There is much to see in and around Dharamsala. On a full-day guided
          tour you can visit the Dalai Lama’s temple and join the Tibetan
          pilgrims on their traditional “kora” (circuit of the temple complex).
          You can see the buildings that make up the Tibetan Parliament,
          including the library/museum. Surprisingly close to the town, you can
          walk through tea plantations and visit a functioning tea factory. In
          Lower Dharamsala you can visit the fascinating Norbulingka Institute,
          a large complex dedicated to the preservation of Tibetan culture, with
          many workshops producing Tibetan handicrafts, a colourful temple, and
          a peaceful garden café. You can enjoy extensive views of the hills and
          mountains above Dharamsala, and take a short walk through a
          traditional village belonging to the Gaddi people, and visit the
          19th-century St John in the Wilderness church.
