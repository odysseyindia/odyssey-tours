Day 1, Leh
After your awe-inspiring flight to Leh airport, you are met by our representative and transferred to your hotel. Leh is Ladakh's principal town. It used to be one of the busiest market towns on the caravan trade between India and Central Asia. These days it retains a distinctly Central Asian feel. Leh is dominated by the nine-storey Palace, a building in the grand tradition of Tibetan architecture, and is said to have inspired the famous Potala in Lhasa, which was built half a century later.

Given the altitude in Ladakh, it's best to start your tour very slowly, and pick the pace up gradually. Your afternoon is at leisure to start acclimatising.

Suggested hotel: NIMMU HOUSE
Nimmu House is a charming eco-resort nestled at 10,000 feet in the village of Nimmoo, just outside Leh. It is both a wellness retreat (offering yoga and spa therapies), and a great base to explore the Leh valley, with both traditionally-styled rooms and luxury tents in a beautiful orchard. The main building once belonged to a cousin of the Ladakhi king, and has been restored to offer cosy lounges and a great restaurant.


Day 2, Leh
The morning is at leisure to help the acclimatisation process. Stroll around the hotel's lovely grounds, or simply drink gallons of hot tea. 

AFTERNOON WALKING TOUR OF LEH
The best way to see Leh is on a walking tour. Along the main street the Buddhist women with their tall hats chatter freely as they sell vegetables. Narrow lanes veer up through the old city; you pass old dwellings clustered on the slope and end up at the 16th-century Leh Khar Palace and its gompa, the Temple of the Guardian Deities, on top of the hill. Though ruined and austere, Leh Palace still makes an unforgettable backdrop to the mud city.



Day 3, Leh

FULL DAY EXCURSION TO SHEY, THIKSEY AND HEMIS
Today you get to visit the three major Buddhist monasteries around Leh, starting with Shey. This is the oldest of the three monasteries near Leh, and is not in regular use. The monastery contains a two-storey-high statue of the Buddha seated in meditation. 

Up ahead is the twelve-storey, 800-year-old Thiksey Gompa, a good place to witness religious ceremonies. It's a magical moment when the monks say their prayers amidst mystical chanting, the ringing of bells, the clashing of cymbals, and the blowing of horns. 

The Hemis monastery is the biggest and wealthiest monastery in Ladakh. Colourful flags flutter in the breeze from the four pillars in the courtyard.



Day 4, Kyagar
The spectacular three-hour drive from Leh to the Nubra Valley crosses the Khardong La (5,602m), the world's highest motorable mountain pass. From the pass, one can see all the way south over the Indus valley to the seemingly endless Zanskar range, and north to the giants of the Saser massif. 
	
Before the partition of India and Pakistan, the villages of the Nubra Valley were important stops along the famous Silk Route. Every year, over 10,000 pack animals - horses, yaks, Bactrian camels, and a sturdy breed of local sheep - traversed the Nubra region, carrying Varanasi brocades, Chinese silks, pearls, spices, Indian tea, pashmina wool, salt, indigo, opium, carpets, and gold. 

These days, international borders mean that the valley is completely cut off from the outside world for 8 months of the year, but from June to September when the pass connecting it with Leh is open, it becomes an enchanting place to visit, inhabited by exceptionally friendly Ladakhi people.

Kyagar (also called Tegar) is a village along the Nubra River, halfway along the road to the bigger Silk Route stop of Panamik. 

Suggested hotel: LCHANG NANG RETREAT
Lchang Nang Retreat is set amidst an orchard of elm, apricot, and apple trees, with the Siachen river rushing past its western boundary. The cottages, created in the local architectural style using mud, stone and poplar, all have a private garden and sit-out. The restaurant provides a wide array of dishes, and even spa treatments are available here, amid gorgeous views of the snow-capped Himalayas.
	


Day 5, Kyagar

VISIT HUNDAR & DESKIT - AND RIDE A BACTRIAN CAMEL
The Nubra Valley is a sublime mixture of cultivated fields set in an arid desert that glows with white sand surrounded by the Karakoram Range and sliced by rivers. You find here the rare double-humped Bactrian camels once used for transport on the Silk Road. The villages in the Nubra (meaning green) Valley are irrigated and fertile, producing wheat, barley, peas, mustard for oil, and a variety of fruits and nuts, including apple, walnut, apricot and even a few almond trees.      

Hundar was the capital of the erstwhile Nubra kingdom in the 17th century, and is home to the ruined Chamba Gompa. In nearby Deskit, you can visit the 15th-century monastery. This is the most important 
monastery in the Nubra Valley, and the rooms are full of thangka paintings, statues and effigies of the Buddha, and old murals.      

Between Hundar and Diskit lie several kilometres of sand dunes, and Bactrian camels graze on the "forests" of seabuckthorn. You have a unique opportunity to ride a Bactrian camel amidst the sand dunes of this high-altitude desert, with snow-capped mountains on the horizon.



Day 6, Kyagar

EXCURSION TO SAMSTANLING GOMPA, YARAB TSO & PANAMIK HOTSPRINGS
Today you visit the partially-restored 19th-century Samstanling Gompa, situated in a peaceful location overlooking the green fields of Sumur village. A monk is usually available to open the prayer rooms, which house an impressive collection of thangka paintings and well-restored frescoes. The sacred Yarab Tso, nearby, is popularly known as the hidden lake. From the road, there is a short 15-minute walk to the shore of the beautiful lake, a great place for a picnic lunch. 

You then visit Panamik. This was a major halt on the caravan trade route, and is now well known for its medicinal hot springs. 


	
Day 7, Stok
You drive back to the Leh valley today, a journey of about 4 hours. Across the valley from Leh is Stok's, whose main draws are its 14th-century Buddhist monastery with ancient paintings and a 
library with the Buddha’s teachings, its collection of traditional Ladakhi houses, and a 19th-century royal palace. The museum within the palace exhibits artifacts which enlighten visitors about the life of the Ladakh royals, their history, currency and weapons. 

Suggested hotel: STOK PALACE
Belonging to the royal Namgyal family, this converted palace is part of Ladakh's cultural heritage. The 200-year-old mural-adorned walls, the Buddhist chants, a traditional Ladakhi meal under apricot and walnut trees, are the Ladakhi way of life. Perched on a hill, the building is stately outside and mysterious inside, with shaded corridors and courtyards, and richly-decorated suites. There is also a pleasant café, offering fine terrace views.



Day 8, Stok

DAY AT LEISURE IN STOK
When you stay at Stok Palace, you immerse yourself in the Ladakhi way of life: the 200-year-old mural-adorned walls, the sound of Buddhist chants from the palace temple or a traditional Ladakhi meal in the royal kitchen, and evening tea in the shade of the magnificent old apricot and walnut trees.    

Guests staying at the Stok Palace Heritage Hotel have privileged access to a Buddhist temple on the upper-most floor of the palace. The resident monk here performs daily prayers and rituals as part of his duties. Guests are welcome to be quiet observers to this enchanting routine.    

Near the palace is the 14th-century Stok Gompa. Though some of the 550-year-old original construction remains, the monastery’s main assembly hall is relatively recent – it was renovated about 50 years ago, and freshly painted with murals. A throne in this hall is reserved for the Dalai Lama. The monastery has a notable library including a collection of the Buddha's own teachings in their Tibetan translation. Next to the monastery is the 71 feet (22 m) high seated Gautama Buddha statue and temple, consecrated by the 14th Dalai Lama in 2016.



Day 9, Leh
Today, you drive to Leh airport to board your onward flight.
