        title: Leh
        content: >-
          Leh is Ladakh’s principal town. It used to be one of the busiest
          market towns on the caravan trade between India and Central Asia.
          These days it retains a distinctly Central Asian feel. Leh is
          dominated by the nine-storey palace, a building in the grand tradition
          of Tibetan architecture, and is said to have inspired the famous
          Potala in Lhasa, which was built half a century later.


          Given the altitude in Ladakh, it’s best to start your tour very
          slowly, and pick the pace up gradually. Your afternoon is at leisure
          to start acclimatising.

        content: >-
          Nimmu House is a charming eco-resort nestled at 10,000 feet in the
          village of Nimmoo, just outside Leh. It is both a wellness retreat
          (offering yoga and spa therapies), and a great base to explore the Leh
          valley, with both traditionally-styled rooms and luxury tents in a
          beautiful orchard. The main building once belonged to a cousin of the
          Ladakhi king, and has been restored to offer cosy lounges and a great
          restaurant.

          The morning is at leisure to help the acclimatisation process. Stroll
          around the hotel’s lovely grounds, or simply drink gallons of hot tea.


          In the afternoon, you take an easy walking tour of the city. Along the
          main street the Buddhist women with their tall hats chatter freely as
          they sell vegetables. Narrow lanes veer up through the old city; you
          pass old dwellings clustered on the slope and end up at the
          16th-century Leh Khar Palace and its gompa, the Temple of the Guardian
          Deities, on top of the hill. Though ruined and austere, Leh Palace
          still makes an unforgettable backdrop to the mud city.

        title: Full day excursion to Shey, Thikse and Hemis monasteries
        content: >-
          Today you get to visit the three major Buddhist monasteries around
          Leh, starting with Shey. This is the oldest of the three monasteries
          near Leh, and is not in regular use. The monastery contains a
          two-storey-high statue of the Buddha seated in meditation.


          Up ahead is the twelve-storey, 800-year-old Thikse Gompa, a good place
          to witness religious ceremonies. It’s a magical moment when the monks
          say their prayers amidst mystical chanting, the ringing of bells, the
          clashing of cymbals, and the blowing of horns.


          The Hemis monastery is the biggest and wealthiest monastery in Ladakh.
          Colourful flags flutter in the breeze from the four pillars in the
          courtyard.

          The spectacular three-hour drive from Leh to the Nubra Valley crosses
          the Khardong La (5,602m), the world’s highest motorable mountain pass.
          From the pass, one can see all the way south over the Indus valley to
          the seemingly endless Zanskar range, and north to the giants of the
          Saser massif. Before the partition of India and Pakistan, the villages
          of the Nubra Valley were important stops along the famous Silk Route.
          Every year, over 10,000 pack animals - horses, yaks, Bactrian camels,
          and a sturdy breed of local sheep - traversed the Nubra region,
          carrying Varanasi brocades, Chinese silks, pearls, spices, Indian tea,
          pashmina wool, salt, indigo, opium, carpets, and gold.


          These days, international borders mean that the valley is completely
          cut off from the outside world for 8 months of the year, but from June
          to September when the pass connecting it with Leh is open, it becomes
          an enchanting place to visit, inhabited by exceptionally friendly
          Ladakhi people.


          Kyagar (also called Tegar) is a village along the Nubra River, halfway
          along the road to the bigger Silk Route stop of Panamik.

          Lchang Nang Retreat is set amidst an orchard of elm, apricot, and
          apple trees, with the Siachen river rushing past its western boundary.
          The cottages, created in the local architectural style using mud,
          stone and poplar, all have a private garden and sit-out. The
          restaurant provides a wide array of dishes, and even spa treatments
          are available here, amid gorgeous views of the snow-capped Himalayas.

        title: Visit Hundar and Deskit - and ride a Bactrian camel
        content: >-
          The Nubra Valley is a sublime mixture of cultivated fields set in an
          arid desert that glows with white sand surrounded by the Karakoram
          Range and sliced by rivers. You find here the rare double-humped
          Bactrian camels once used for transport on the Silk Road. The villages
          in the Nubra (meaning green) Valley are irrigated and fertile,
          producing wheat, barley, peas, mustard for oil, and a variety of
          fruits and nuts, including apple, walnut, apricot and even a few
          almond trees.


          Hundar was the capital of the erstwhile Nubra kingdom in the 17th
          century, and is home to the ruined Chamba Gompa. In nearby Deskit, you
          can visit the 15th-century monastery. This is the most important
          monastery in the Nubra Valley, and the rooms are full of thangka
          paintings, statues and effigies of the Buddha, and old murals.


          Between Hundar and Diskit lie several kilometres of sand dunes, and
          Bactrian camels graze on the “forests” of seabuckthorn. You have a
          unique opportunity to ride a Bactrian camel amidst the sand dunes of
          this high-altitude desert, with snow-capped mountains on the horizon.

        title: Excursion to Samstanling gompa, Yarab Tso, and the Panamik hot springs
        content: >-
          Today you visit the partially-restored 19th-century Samstanling Gompa,
          situated in a peaceful location overlooking the green fields of Sumur
          village. A monk is usually available to open the prayer rooms, which
          house an impressive collection of thangka paintings and well-restored
          frescoes. The sacred Yarab Tso, nearby, is popularly known as the
          hidden lake. From the road, there is a short 15-minute walk to the
          shore of the beautiful lake, a great place for a picnic lunch.


          You then visit Panamik. This was a major halt on the caravan trade
          route, and is now well known for its medicinal hot springs.

          You drive back to the Leh valley today, a journey of about 4 hours.
          Across the valley from Leh is Stok’s, whose main draws are its
          14th-century Buddhist monastery with ancient paintings and a library
          with the Buddha’s teachings, its collection of traditional Ladakhi
          houses, and a 19th-century royal palace. The museum within the palace
          exhibits artifacts which enlighten visitors about the life of the
          Ladakh royals, their history, currency and weapons.

          Belonging to the royal Namgyal family, this converted palace is part
          of Ladakh’s cultural heritage. The 200-year-old mural-adorned walls,
          the Buddhist chants, a traditional Ladakhi meal under apricot and
          walnut trees, are the Ladakhi way of life. Perched on a hill, the
          building is stately outside and mysterious inside, with shaded
          corridors and courtyards, and richly-decorated suites. There is also a
          pleasant café, offering fine terrace views.

        content: >-
          When you stay at Stok Palace, you immerse yourself in the Ladakhi way
          of life: the 200-year-old mural-adorned walls, the sound of Buddhist
          chants from the palace temple or a traditional Ladakhi meal in the
          royal kitchen, and evening tea in the shade of the magnificent old
          apricot and walnut trees.


          Guests staying at the Stok Palace Heritage Hotel have privileged
          access to a Buddhist temple on the upper-most floor of the palace. The
          resident monk here performs daily prayers and rituals as part of his
          duties. Guests are welcome to be quiet observers to this enchanting
          routine.


          Near the palace is the 14th-century Stok Gompa. Though some of the
          550-year-old original construction remains, the monastery’s main
          assembly hall is relatively recent – it was renovated about 50 years
          ago, and freshly painted with murals. A throne in this hall is
          reserved for the Dalai Lama. The monastery has a notable library
          including a collection of the Buddha’s own teachings in their Tibetan
          translation. Next to the monastery is the 71 feet (22 m) high seated
          Gautama Buddha statue and temple, consecrated by the 14th Dalai Lama
          in 2016.
