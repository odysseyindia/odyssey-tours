Day 1, Delhi
You start your tour on arrival in Delhi, where you will be met by our representative and transferred to your hotel.

Delhi is practically two cities: New Delhi, the capital of India, and medieval Old Delhi. The old city centres around the Red Fort, which contains opulent palaces and impressive public buildings. Nearby is the magnificent Jama Masjid, India’s largest mosque. In New Delhi you can find India Gate - a war memorial arch, the impressive Parliament Building and Rashtrapati Bhawan, the residence of the President. Towards the South are Qutab Minar and Humayun's Tomb, both World Heritage Sites.


Suggested hotel: COLONEL'S RETREAT
Colonel's Retreat is a very pleasant and homely guest house in an upmarket, tree-lined neighborhood. The large rooms are comfortable and artistically furnished. Each floor boasts a lovely lounge area with comfortable sofas for relaxing, books to read and borrow, and computers. A private rooftop dining area gives you a lovely view of the city.


Day 2, Delhi
	Morning tour of Old Delhi by metro & rickshaw. Afternoon at leisure.
	HALF DAY TOUR OF OLD DELHI BY METRO & RICKSHAW
	A half-day tour to Old Delhi using the modern Metro and the traditional cycle rickshaw. The Metro brings you to the heart 
of Old Delhi in just a few minutes, to visit the magnificent Jama Masjid mosque, India's largest. You then use walk and ride cycle rickshaws through the fascinating maze of narrow streets around the main street of Old Delhi, Chandni Chowk, a 
	bustling jumble of craft shops, traders, mosques and temples.   At one end of this street is the huge Red Fort, the symbol 
	of Delhi, which contains within it palaces and impressive public buildings. At the other is the colourful and aromatic Spice 
	Market, the roof of which offers great views over Old Delhi. You can also visit the bustling and colourful Sikh Gurdwara. 
	Whilst returning to the hotel by Metro at the end of the tour, you may choose to stop off at Connaught Place to enjoy the 
	many restaurants and more modern shops.   

Note: We will not be visiting the interior of the Red Fort because on this tour we concentrate on the narrow alleys and atmosphere of Old Delhi. However, you could arrange with your local guide to see the Red Fort at the end of your half-day tour. Please also note that the Red Fort is closed on Mondays and national holidays.

Day 3, Binsar
Today, you start bright and early, with a train and an hour's drive that take you to the beautiful Himalayan foothills. Bhimtal is a small town in the Kumaon hills, at an altitude of more than 1,500m above sea level. One of the most famous attractions of this place is Bhimtal Lake located bang in the middle of town. The most relaxing thing to do in Bhimtal is going on an easy hike, and to do some amateur birding - or simply goggle at the snow-clad Himalayan peaks, which look close enough to touch.

Suggested hotel: FREDY'S BUNGALOW
This colonial-style homestead nestles among cypress and deodar trees, on a peaceful wooded hillside overlooking the Bhimtal valley. This peaceful, cosy haven is a birder's and butterfly-watcher's paradise, and a haven for writers seeking a retreat.


Day 4, Bhimtal
EXPLORING LAKES AND BIRDING
Today, rise early to explore the Sattal (seven lakes region). Set amongst dense forests of oak and pine trees, Sattal is one of the few unspoiled and unpolluted freshwater biomes in India. The Sattal and Bhimtal (the lake of Lord Bhim, from the Mahabharata) lakes are a paradise for migratory birds. You will enjoy a picnic breakfast en route to Sattal. After returning to Fredy's Bungalow for lunch, you head off in the late afternoon to walk around Chafi, one of the nicest birding spots in the hills. Look for whistling thrushes and spotted owls, among others.


Day 5, Thikalna
Today, we drive for about three hours to the market town of Almora. You can spend some time exploring this ancient hill town, and visit the temple of Golu Devta, the god of justice, just outside the town. The temple, unusually, is full of brass bells, hung up as offerings by devotees.

You then limber up for your walking tour with a 1-hour stroll through oak and rhododendron forests to the village of Thikalna. This is a small village with terraced valleys, deodar forests, rhododendron trails and yellow mustard fields, with views of the stunning snow-capped Nanda Devi.

Suggested hotel: THIKALNA HIMALAYAN RETREAT
An old local house in the village of Thikalna was renovated into a cute, colourful stay, with views of Nanda Devi East and other Himalayan highlights from the cliff-edge courtyard. Though simple, it's a cosy, authentic two-bedroom house, ideal for exploring the hills.
	

Day 6, Thikalna

WALKING AROUND THIKALNA
Today, you have a pleasant 4-5 hour walking round trip from Thikalna (at your own pace), exploring the nearby villages and woodland, complete with a picnic lunch. Sights on the trail include villages buzzing with little children, people farming their fields, elderly men enjoying their hookah over tea, cattle grazing, the elegant magpie, and much more. 


Day 7, Kotnaikana

After a leisurely breakfast, walk along the ridge towards Saukiyatal temple and the Jageshwar temple complex with beautiful views of the Nanda Devi range on your left. Nearing Jageshwar in a valley you will notice the pine forest now change to thick deodar (cedar). The temples at Jageshwar are believed to have been constructed between the 8th and 18th centuries.

You'll have a picnic lunch after visiting the temples, and then carry on through pleasant forests to the villages of Kotnaikana, where you stay the night. The entire walk today takes about five hours. You also have a 15-minute walk later to a sunset point near the house. You can spend the evening by a bonfire.

Suggested hotel: JHAKERSM VILLAGE HOUSE
In the midst of oak, rhododendron, pine, and deodar forest is a painstakingly renovated old house, now a two-bedroom homestay that's a treat for nature lovers.




Day 8, Binsar
Your 4-5 hour walk today takes you past the Jhakersm temple, then descends to terraced farms and small villages. After a picnic lunch at the bottom, you then walk uphill to the lovely Itmenaan Estate, in Binsar.	

The Binsar Valley is located in the Nanda Devi range of the Kumaon Himalayas, which are on the border between India and Nepal. Most visitors come for the 300-kilometre panorama of Himalayan peaks, and to visit the storied hill villages. Its location offers stunning views and makes the Binsar Valley a good base for bird-watching and walks through the beautiful pine and deodar woods.

Suggested hotel: ITMENAAN ESTATE
Itmenaan Estate is a fairytale resort near Binsar, one of the most beautiful spots in the Kumaon Himalayas. The 10-acre resort includes virgin pine, oak and rhododendron trees and even a little natural spring. This restored 100-year-old house offers panoramic views of the Himalayas including the majestic Nanda Devi, and plenty of pleasant walks around - or just a delightful place to put your feet up and enjoy Kumaoni hospitality.


Day 9, Binsar

DAY AT LEISURE AT ITMENAAN ESTATE
At Itmenaan Estate you may choose to just 'do nothing' - laze around or read a book, admire mesmerising valleys and snow-clad peaks, enjoy the warmth of a bonfire, gaze at the countless stars at night time or just gorge yourself on lovely Kumaoni thali meals. Those who are looking for some more walking within and around the estate you may trek to the highest point for enchanting views or roam the beautiful oak and rhododendron forests.


Day 10, Delhi
Today, after a leisurely breakfast, you have a short walk to the road-head, from where you will be driven to Kathgodam railway station to board a train to Delhi.

Suggested hotel: THE METROPOLITAN HOTEL

The hotel has 3 restaurants including one serving authentic Japanese cuisine. There is a swimming pool, an excellent large spa, a fashion & lifestyle store and an art gallery.
