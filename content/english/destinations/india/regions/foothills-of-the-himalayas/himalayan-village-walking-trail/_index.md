          Delhi is practically two cities: New Delhi, the capital of India, and
          medieval Old Delhi. The old city centres around the Red Fort, which
          contains opulent palaces and impressive public buildings. Nearby is
          the magnificent Jama Masjid, India’s largest mosque. In New Delhi you
          can find India Gate - a war memorial arch, the impressive Parliament
          Building and Rashtrapati Bhawan, the residence of the President.
          Towards the South are Qutab Minar and Humayun’s Tomb, both World
          Heritage Sites.

        title: Morning guided tour of Old Delhi by Metro & rickshaw
        content: >-
          A half-day tour to Old Delhi using the modern Metro and the
          traditional cycle rickshaw. The Metro brings you to the heart of Old
          Delhi in just a few minutes, to visit the magnificent Jama Masjid
          mosque, India’s largest. You then use walk and ride cycle rickshaws
          through the fascinating maze of narrow streets around the main street
          of Old Delhi, Chandni Chowk, a bustling jumble of craft shops,
          traders, mosques and temples.


          At one end of this street is the huge Red Fort, the symbol of Delhi,
          which contains within it palaces and impressive public buildings.
          (Please note, though, that we will not go inside the Red Fort, because
          on this tour we concentrate on the narrow alleys and atmosphere of Old
          Delhi. However, you could arrange with your local guide to see the Red
          Fort at the end of your half-day tour). At the other end of Chandni
          Chowk is the colourful and aromatic Spice Market, the roof of which
          offers great views over Old Delhi. You can also visit the bustling and
          colourful Sikh Gurdwara.


          The rest of your day is at leisure. If you’d like to go shopping or
          explore a bit more after the tour, you can take the Metro to vibrant
          Connaught Place to enjoy the many restaurants and more modern shops.

          Today, you start bright and early, with a train and an hour’s drive
          that take you to the beautiful Himalayan foothills.


          Bhimtal is a small town in the Kumaon hills, at an altitude of more
          than 1,500m above sea level. One of the most famous attractions of
          this place is Bhimtal Lake located bang in the middle of town. The
          most relaxing thing to do in Bhimtal is going on an easy hike, and to
          do some amateur birding - or simply goggle at the snow-clad Himalayan
          peaks, which look close enough to touch.

          Today, rise early to explore the Sattal (seven lakes region). Set
          amongst dense forests of oak and pine trees, Sattal is one of the few
          unspoiled and unpolluted freshwater biomes in India. The Sattal and
          Bhimtal (the lake of Lord Bhim, from the Mahabharata) lakes are a
          paradise for migratory birds. You will enjoy a picnic breakfast en
          route to Sattal.


          After returning to Fredy’s Bungalow for lunch, you head off in the
          late afternoon to walk around Chafi, one of the nicest birding spots
          in the hills. Look for whistling thrushes and spotted owls, among
          others.

          You can spend some time exploring this ancient hill town, and visit
          the temple of Golu Devta, the god of justice, just outside the town.
          The temple, unusually, is full of brass bells, hung up as offerings by
          devotees.


          You then limber up for your walking tour with a 1-hour stroll through
          oak and rhododendron forests to the village of Thikalna. This is a
          small village with terraced valleys, deodar forests, rhododendron
          trails and yellow mustard fields, with views of the stunning
          snow-capped Nanda Devi.

          After a leisurely breakfast, walk along the ridge towards Saukiyatal

          at Jageshwar are believed to have been constructed between the 8th and
          18th centuries.

You will stay in converted village houses and British-era homesteads with beautiful wood panelling and cosy sitouts. A wonderful, leisurely way of seeing a lovely part of India.
