Mumbai's first real boutique hotel, The Abode draws on the city's art deco heritage to create a quirky little space a minute away from the Gateway of India. The small but cheerful rooms bring old Mumbai styles right to you, and the delightful cafe serves as a common and reception area, with Mumbai chai and snacks. A great, fun option if you want to explore South Mumbai's colonial past.
