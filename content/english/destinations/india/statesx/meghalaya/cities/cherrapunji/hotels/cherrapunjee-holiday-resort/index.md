The enthusiastic owners of this simple but spotlessly clean and comfortable small hotel have been instrumental in developing the tourist attractions around Cherrapunjee, in particular the well-maintained trekking paths to the spectacular living root bridges, for which they provide knowledgeable trekking guides. They also serve delicious and authentic local Khasi food, making this a perfect base for the adventurous traveller.
