A small classical building right on the banks of the river, Palace on Ganges is situated on Assi Ghat, one of the most interesting and colouful areas of the city. The rooms are themed on the various states of India. There are no views from the rooms themselves, a few of which do not have windows, but they are clean and comfortable. The views from the terrace restaurant are of the endless, endlessly busy curve of the river.
