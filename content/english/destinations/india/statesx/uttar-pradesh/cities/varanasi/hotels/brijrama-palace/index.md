This is by far the most upscale hotel on the banks of the River Ganges. A centuries-old palace, it has been restored while retaining its character and features such as the original elevator - India's first. The guest rooms and the many public areas are lavishly furnished with antiques, many from Rajasthan. Included in your stay are activities like yoga classes, high tea, evening classical music performances, and boat rides.
