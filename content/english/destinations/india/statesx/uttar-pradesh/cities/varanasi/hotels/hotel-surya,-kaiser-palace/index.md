Built by King Kaiser of Nepal in 1818, Hotel Surya is a heritage palace in Varanasi's Cantonment area, with a mixture of traditional and modern elements. The hotel is located only 6 m away from the main ghats and 8km from Sarnath, making this the perfect location to see everything while in Varanasi.
