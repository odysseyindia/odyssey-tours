This hotel is one of the best on the "Buddhist Circuit", and it is a pleasant surprise to find such a comfortable and well run property in such a remote area. The staff are very friendly and helpful. The chef is well versed in preparing dishes from throughout Asia to cater to the pilgrims from different Buddhist nations - we recommend asking him for the "Thai Special Meal" - delicious!
