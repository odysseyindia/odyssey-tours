Mathura, 50km from Agra on the west bank of the Yamuna, is the place where the popular god Krishna is believed to have been born and spent his early years. Mathura's ancient structures were mostly destroyed by Muslims but it's still a religious centre full of Hindu temples that attract floods of pilgrims, particularly during Janmastami (Krishna's birthday) in August/September.
