The Tourist Lodge has been privatized and is now Hotel Metsuben, by far the best place in town to stay the night. It is well situated on a hill close to the centre of town. Hotel Metsuben offers comfortable rooms with cable T.V., telephone and electricity back-up. There is a restaurant that offers Naga, Indian and Chinese cuisine, and a small internet cafe with broadband internet facilities in the lobby.
