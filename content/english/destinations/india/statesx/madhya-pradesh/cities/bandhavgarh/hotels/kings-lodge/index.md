A charming, rustic-feeling but upmarket lodge, set in a large, forested area. Designed to resemble the wattle-and-daub houses of local tribes, the lodge offers a generous lounge area, decorated with tribal motifs, nicely-sized cottages with sitouts (some on stilts), and a small swimming pool. The lodge has its own naturalists and a focus on eco-tourism, and the grounds are used well, with meals possible in various locations.
