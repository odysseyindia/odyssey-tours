Mahua Kothi or homestead is named after the mahua tree. The luxury mud cottages blend into a 45-acre private forest on the periphery of the national park. The lovely guest area overlooks a large grassland where monkeys and birds in vivid colours are a regular feature. A bean-shaped pool, shaded by mahua trees, is perfect for cooling off between game drives, and guests can relax at the spa or just lounge around the grounds.
