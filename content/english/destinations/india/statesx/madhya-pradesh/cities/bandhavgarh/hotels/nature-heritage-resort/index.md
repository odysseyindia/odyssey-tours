Nature Heritage Resort is a jungle lodge located in the lush green surroundings of Bandhavgarh National Park. Each of the air-conditioned cottages has its own personal verandah on which to relax. There is a thatched-roof restaurant where breakfast and lunch are served. The resort also has a swimming pool and spa. Evenings are a relaxed affair around the bonfire, where conversation is followed by a lavish dinner.
