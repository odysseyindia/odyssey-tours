Built to resemble Orchha's palaces of the distinctive 'Bundela' style, Amar Mahal is a low white building with open lawns, with comfortable rooms surrounding a large swimming pool. Its gardens have an unrestricted view of the famous royal cenotaphs and there are plenty of comfortable outdoor spots in which to relax in and enjoy the sense of space and peace.
