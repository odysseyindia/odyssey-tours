Built in 1890 and set in 5 sprawling acres, the Jehan Numa Palace Hotel is the beautifully-preserved erstwhile home of the rulers of Bhopal. The abundance of space has also allowed for airy rooms with large beds and stylish colonial furniture in dark wood. Unlike most city hotels, Jehan Numa boasts of wide balconies, open lawns, fountains and many inviting spots to relax and unwind after a day of sightseeing.
