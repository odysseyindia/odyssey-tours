The aptly-named Baghvan (tiger's forest) lies right next to the boundary of Pench national park, and features spectacular cottages, each with an ar-conditioned bedroom, an outdoor shower and a machan with outdoor bed. As a Taj property, it has high service standards, a wonderful lounge and public areas, a swimming pool, and great food. The turquoise and copper accents add colour to the luxurious safari experience.
