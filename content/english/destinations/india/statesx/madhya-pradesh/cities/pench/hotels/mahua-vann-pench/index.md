Mahua Vann Pench is a boutique eco-resort, just 6km from the Turia Gate of Pench wildlife reserve.  The resort is spread across a large estate. Each of the rooms is comfortably sized, tastefully decorated and equipped with modern amenities yet maintaining an earthen touch. With a rivulet crossing right through the resort, there are plenty of activities, including nature walks, cycling tours, swimming pool & spa.
