Selected as one of the world's 101 best hotels by TATLER, the Ahilya Fort belonging to the Holkar dynasty of Indore, is a charming example of 18th-century Maratha architecture. Broad, dark wood beams, cool secluded rooms and sweet-smelling creepers welcome you and the wide views over the Narmada River and temples encourage you to linger. All meals are prepared using organic, home-grown vegetables.
