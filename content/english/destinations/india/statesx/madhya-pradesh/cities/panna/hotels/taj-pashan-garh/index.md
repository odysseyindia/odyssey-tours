The most upscale option at Panna National Park, this resort sits atop a small hill, with a sweeping view of dense foliage. Set in 200 acres of private wilderness, this luxury jungle lodge draws inspiration from the dry-packed stone houses of the region. There are airy public spaces, gorgeous cottages and in-house naturalists, a swimming pool, alfresco dining (or even emals served in vintage palanquins) - a good way to do safaris in style.
