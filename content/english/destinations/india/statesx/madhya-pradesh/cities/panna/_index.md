A wildlife park that has been regenerated to rude good health, Panna is now practically saturated with tigers, and sightings have been excellent. Just an hour and a half from Khajuraho, this park is known for tigers, leopards and superb birding opportunities across its hilly landscape. The naturalists will take care to point out small details about vultures and rocks as well as the big cats - a complete wilderness experience.
