A delightful upscale beach resort overlooking the Bay of Bengal, this is a great place to relax in comfort. There is a palm-filled garden with a swimming pool and cabanas for relaxing. Complimentary tea and snacks are served at sunrise and sunset in a kiosk overlooking the beach. All rooms are large, as are the bathrooms, many of which boast deep bathtubs, and each room has a balcony with comfortable "day beds" for relaxation.
