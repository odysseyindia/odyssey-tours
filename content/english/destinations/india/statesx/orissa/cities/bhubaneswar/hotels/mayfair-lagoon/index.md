Low-roofed, fat-pillared cottages, a spa and long courtyards make up this resort, built around a vast artificial lagoon. Graceful, statuettes and black-and-white photographs of Indian royals line the corridors leading to the sumptuous rooms. There are several dining options: a multi-cuisine restaurant, North and South Indian, an Italian cafe, a Scottish-themed bar, a Chinese restaurant, and a traditional Odia eatery.
