The state of Orissa is not widely visited by foreign tourists, despite having many attractions: These include the Sun temple at Konarak, outstanding temple architecture in Bhubaneswar and Puri, and the serenely beautiful Chilika lake, Asia's largest saltwater body.     Add to this the long sandy beach at Puri, with its distinctive green/blue waters, and you will find Orissa an unusual but worthwhile destination.
