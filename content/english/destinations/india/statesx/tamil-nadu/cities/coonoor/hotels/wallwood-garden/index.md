Wallwood Garden, earlier known as Blair Athol, built over 100 years ago by a Scottish Major General, is now a part of the Neemrana Group. It offers 8 cosy rooms, each named after trees, and a pleasant garden and a lounge with a fireplace. The mansion retains the atmosphere of the past and is located very close to Sim's Park, a large botanical garden with 1,200 species of plants and rare trees.
