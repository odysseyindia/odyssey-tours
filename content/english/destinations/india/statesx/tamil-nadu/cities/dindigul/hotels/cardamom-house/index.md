Cardamom House is owned by a retired British physician. The atmosphere is informal, and the daily activities of the house are tailored to accommodate the personal programmes of the guests. It is a small homestay with 6 double rooms and a suite which can also be divided into two separate rooms. All rooms are named after an Indian spice or herb, and all have superb views of Athoor Lake and the Western ghats.
