The Bangala, the Tamil pronunciation of 'The Bungalow', is an elegant boutique heritage hotel in a property that has been developed over the last 75 years. The hotel has comfortable, air-conditioned double bedrooms, with attached bathrooms, and a pleasant poolside area. The rooms are simply but elegantly furnished, and some have four-poster beds. The hotel has gained fame for its genuine home-cooked Chettinad food.
