Chettinad (or Chettinadu) is a region in the heart of Tamil Nadu, dominated by the prosperous Chettiar community of businessmen and bankers. Around the 19th and early 20th century, the Chettiars traded in everything from salt to gems, with countries like Burma, Malaysia and Singapore. They built palatial residences with materials sourced from all over the world, many now converted into elegant hotels. Chettinad is also famous for its exciting cuisine.
