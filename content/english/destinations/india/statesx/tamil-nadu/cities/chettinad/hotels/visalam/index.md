The beautifully polished traditional red terracotta floors are a highlight of this Chettiar mansion, as is the handcrafted teak wood furniture. The ceilings are lofty and the spaces uncluttered. The overall feel is definitely one of a home rather than a hotel, something reinforced by the warm and attentive service of the staff. A great place to catch your breath on a South India tour.
