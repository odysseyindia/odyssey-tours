A new, airy hotel in Madurai, known for its spacious rooms, pleasantly decorated with wood carvings, and for the art that lines practically every wall. Thereâ€™s even an audio-guide tour of the hotel, which tells you the history of Madurai through sketches and paintings. There is a pleasant pool and a choice between the multi-cuisine restaurant on the ground floor and a specialty South Indian one on the rooftop terrace.
