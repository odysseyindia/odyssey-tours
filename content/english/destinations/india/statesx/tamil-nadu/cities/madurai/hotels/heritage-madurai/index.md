This property was designed in the 1970s by renowned Sri Lankan architect Geoffrey Bawa as the Coat's Madurai Club. It has now been artfully renovated; the result is a hotel with lots of charm, and huge rooms. The restaurant serves Indian and international cuisine and there is a magnificent swimming pool to enjoy. There is also a 'heritage village', where you can see a potter at work, have some tea, and take a cooking class.
