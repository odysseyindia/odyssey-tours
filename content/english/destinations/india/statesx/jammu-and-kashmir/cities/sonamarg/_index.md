Sonamarg, a popular hill town in the Kashmir valley, rests at an altitude of 2,740m above sea level. Surrounded by snow-capped mountains and lush meadows, the city of Sonamarg lies before the Zoji La Pass. The literal meaning of the word Sonamarg is meadow of gold. The place received its name because of the fact that during the spring season, it is enveloped with beautiful flowers that look golden.
