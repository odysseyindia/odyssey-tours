Jammu is J&K's winter capital. Pre-Independence the city was the seat of the powerful Dogra dynasty, whose palaces remain the city's most appealing sights.  Jammu has a predominantly Hindu population and has some temples which are historically significant, but for most travelers Jammu will mainly be a useful stop for making transport connections to Amritsar, Srinagar or Dharamsala.
