Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu & Kashmir, is a city of lakes and waterways, gardens and picturesque wooden architecture. The old quarters of the city sprawl over both sides of the Jhelum river, crossed by seven bridges. At the city's edge are the idyllic Dal and Nagin Lakes, linked by a network of backwaters. It is so beautiful that it's easy to see why everyone from the Mughals to the Raj once flocked here.
