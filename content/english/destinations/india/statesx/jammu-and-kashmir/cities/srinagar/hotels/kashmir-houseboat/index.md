Staying on a Kashmir Houseboat is a unique travel experience. Entirely built of elaborately-carved wood, each houseboat features a large lounge with comfortable sofas and divans, a traditional dining room with antique furniture, and 3 or 4 large bedrooms, all lavishly furnished, and with modern attached bathrooms. You can relax on the verandah of your houseboat overlooking the serene Nageen Lake and the mountains beyond.
