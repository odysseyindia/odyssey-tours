Grossly underrated and often completely overlooked by travellers, Gujarat is an ideal tourist destination offering a little bit of everything.     Fascinating archeological sites, Jain, Hindu and Islamic architecture, a wide variety of scenery, exquisite crafts, rare wildlife, and some beautiful beaches are among Gujarat's attractions.
