This rapidly-expanding industrial centre, previously Baroda, was once the capital of the powerful Gaekwad princely state. It remains a pleasant and relaxing place, with interesting museums, art galleries and a fine park. The once-opulent Laxmi Vilas Palace's interiors are decorated with Venetian mosaic, Italian marble, porcelain, European stained glass, etc. Pavagadh fort's ruins are worth visiting too, with ancient temples.
