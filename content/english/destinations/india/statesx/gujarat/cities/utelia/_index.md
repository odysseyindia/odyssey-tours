The little village of Utelia is the archetypal Indian hamlet: sun-browned children run to greet you, and tiled roofs sit cheek to jowl. Utelia is also the best base from which to explore the excavations of Lothal, the 4,500-year-old city of the Indus Valley Civilization. The site reveals an extremely well planned city with public baths, a sophisticated drainage system and even a dock that welcomed seafaring ships.
