Vijay Vilas Palace is a charming heritage home-stay in the shadow of Shatrunjay Hill. The palace has been tastefully decorated with delicate Victorian furniture and warm colours. This quaint, 100-year-old property was built by the local Maharaja; his descendants, Mr. Yashpal Singh and his wife are available for long conversations, while you savour the peace of the countryside and sample the exquisite home-cooked food.
