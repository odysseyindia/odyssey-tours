The tribal people of Hodka, with the support of development agencies, built the Shaam-E-Sarhad Resort, using only local building materials and natural products used also in their own houses. You can visit different families to see their nicely decorated and painted mud houses, learn about their livelihoods and customs and admire their fine embroideries and leather works.
