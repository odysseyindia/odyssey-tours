Shri Joravar Vilas Palace at Santrampur is a lakeside Heritage getaway offering a gateway into tribal areas of Gujarat. The palace was built in 1926 in Art Deco style. Five contemporary rooms and suites occupy the ground floor of the building, surrounding a magnificent central courtyard. Inside the suite and out, a confluence of royal aesthetics adorns the walls, the bathrooms, the tables, the door knockers, and the furniture.
