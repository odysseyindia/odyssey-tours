The old port of Mandvi is famous for its centuries-old tradition of handcrafted dhows. These sturdy ocean boats, which travel as far as Africa, are built from staggeringly large planks of Malaysian sal and local woods. Mandvi's craftsmen hail from different communities and still practice traditional methods of shipbuilding, such as filling gaps with cotton and oil, which swells up in water and plugs the holes.
