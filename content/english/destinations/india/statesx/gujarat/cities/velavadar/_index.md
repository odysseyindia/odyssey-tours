Velavadar National Park is a grassland tract rich in wildlife, including India's largest herds of blackbuck (Indian antelope), the endangered Indian wolf and striped hyena, and smaller mammals like jackal, jungle cat, Indian fox and hare. For birdwatchers, this national park is home to specialties like saras crane and Stolickza's bushchat. Between November and February, Velavadar is the largest roosting site for harriers.
