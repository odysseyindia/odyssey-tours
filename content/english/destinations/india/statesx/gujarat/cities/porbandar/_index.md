The birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi, Porbandar was the capital of an important princely state and has many historic buildings. The creeks attract flocks of flamingos, waders and wagtails. Spectacular flocks of wintering cranes can be seen at the dams and wetlands. It is an excellent area for gulls and terns and one of the best places for great crested tern in winter. There are two bird sanctuaries, at Porbandar lake and Barda.
