Rann Riders is a resort featuring different types of traditional Gujarati and tribal homes set around well-kept lawns and shady trees. These mud, stone and tiled cottages are all furnished with modern comforts while preserving the essential rural feel of the homes. This eco-friendly resort is a good base from which to explore the salt plains and wetlands that form the Rann of Kutch.
