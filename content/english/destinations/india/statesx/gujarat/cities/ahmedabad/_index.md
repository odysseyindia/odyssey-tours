Ahmedabad is the cultural capital of Gujarat and a major textile and crafts centre. The city is packed with diverse architectural styles, with over fifty mosques and tombs, as well as Hindu and Jain temples and grand, beautifully-carved step-wells. The old part of town is a maze of narrow winding alleys with carved wooden house-fronts and thriving bazaars.
