The House of MG is a bastion of tranquility and early 20th-century charm against the swirling noise and colour of modern-day Ahmedabad. It has beautifully decorated rooms and a wonderful ambience. Located in the heart of the city, the House of MG is also the home to the perennially popular Agashiye, a rooftop restaurant that serves delicious traditional Gujarati food.
