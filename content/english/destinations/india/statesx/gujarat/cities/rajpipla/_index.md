A former Rajput princely state, Rajpipla was one of the more influential and advanced, with its own private railway line, called the Rajpipla State Railway. The fertility of the region is due to two rivers, the Narmada and the Karjan. The bathing ghats on the Narmada are nearby. The old Vadia Palace is an Indo-Saracenic building from 1930, with interesting murals of drunk monkeys, dancing girls and Krishna with his flute.
