Digboi is famous as the oil town of India, and is home to Asia's first oil well. At the exact spot of this well is now a quaint oil museum. The town still has a distinct flavor of the British times, seen in the many English-style bungalows that remain. You can also visit the Digboi War Cemetery, which has 200 graves of WWII Allied Forces personnel from the UK, India, West Africa, Burma, Belgium, the USA and Italy.
