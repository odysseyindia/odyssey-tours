One of Kaziranga's newer resorts, it is set in the midst of a thick bamboo grove, together with a wide variety of medicinal plants and a plantation of betel nuts and fruit trees. Its architecture is reminiscent of old Assamese houses, set atop bamboo stilts, blending in with the thick foliage. The resort is enhanced by a beautiful lake on the grounds. The rooms are comfy and spacious, with traditional hand-made walls.
