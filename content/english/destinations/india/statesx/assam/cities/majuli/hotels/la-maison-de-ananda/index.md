Located in the by-lane of a small village in India's largest river island, Majuli, staying in the eco-friendly property of La Maison de Ananda is definitely the best way to experience local culture and hospitality. The cottages and rooms (except for one concrete cottage) have all been built of bamboo and stand on stilts, replicating the traditional houses of the local Mishing community. The in-house restaurant serves some delicious Assamese and Mishing cuisine and even a glass of the local rice brew, apong, on request.
