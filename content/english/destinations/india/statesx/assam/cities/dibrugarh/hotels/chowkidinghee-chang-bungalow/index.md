Chowkidinghee Chang Bungalow is a former tea manager's property. It lies within a tea garden in the centre of Dibrugarh. Perched on stilts about 4 four metres above the ground in classic Chang bungalow style, the view from the verandah looks across the tea plantation. The shared area boasts comfortable sofas around a fireplace, a dining area and a TV room, with polished wood flooring throughout.
