Nestled in the Maikal Hills, Satyendra "Sunny" Upadhyay's farm-stay is close to the famous Bhoramdeo temple complex. You can visit the temples, trek in the hills, or simply relax and enjoy the peace and delicious farm-grown food. However, the retreat's main focus is on real interaction with the gentle tribal people who live close by, in their tolas (villages), or while visiting the many colourful weekly haats (tribal markets).
