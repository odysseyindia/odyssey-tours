Lakshadweep is a group of 36 islands, located around 200 miles off off Indiaâ€™s west coast into the Arabian Sea. Only 10 islands are inhabited, mostly by Sunni Muslim fishermen.      The charm of Lakshadweep islands lies in their remoteness, the dense cover of coconut palms, and the thread of an unbroken line of creamy sand. Each island is serenely set in a sea whose waters range from palest aquamarine and turquoise to the deepest sapphire.
