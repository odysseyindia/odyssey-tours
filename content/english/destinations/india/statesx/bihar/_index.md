One of the least visited states of North India, Bihar is in fact an important place in the history of Indian civilization, as the birthplace of Buddhism - for it was here, at Bodh Gaya, that the Buddha gained enlightenment.     Major sites associated with the life and teachings of the Buddha, such as Bodh Gaya, Nalanda, Rajgir, and Vaishali, lie in the dry plains of central Bihar and are the main attractions for visitors.
