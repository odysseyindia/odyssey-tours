This modern hotel is in a peaceful location, but is just a few minutesâ€™ walk from the busy centre of Bodh Gaya. The 40 air-conditioned rooms are simply furnished, but are large, bright and clean - particularly the bathrooms. There is a welcoming lobby with friendly, helpful staff, and an excellent restaurant that offers food from around Asia, as the hotels caters to pilgrims from throughout the Buddhist world.
