Sabine Thierry runs the warm, friendly Coloniale Heritage guest house, located on a quiet tree-lined street. Sabine's family home is now a 6-roomed guesthouse with a pocket-sized garden and lots of little open spaces. There are steep steps, but the rooms and spaces are very inviting, and Sabine is very knowledgeable about Pondicherry.
