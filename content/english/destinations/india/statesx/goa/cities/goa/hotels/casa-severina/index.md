A quiet and elegant retreat, this is an oasis of peace close to the bright lights of North Goa's busiest beach resorts. With a handful of rooms in an elegant low-rise building, this resort has classic Portuguese furniture â€“ four-poster beds and elegant armchairs - and balconies overlooking the pool or the gardens. The famous Calangute beach is a mere five-minute walk away.
