An ultra-stylish beach resort hidden behind one of the most beautiful beaches in Goa, Yab Yum (meaning "the union of one") is a peaceful resort consisting of domed and thatched creations surrounded by coconut trees. With its exciting, unique design and colours, the resort has its own style which defies a label, but is popular with those seeking out "alternative" aspects of Goa, such as yoga and meditation.
