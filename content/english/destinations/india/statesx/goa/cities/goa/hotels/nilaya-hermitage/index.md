Cutting edge chic on a hill-top Nilaya Hermitage is an exclusive boutique hotel, perched on the crest of Arpora hill. It has a spectacular swimming pool and just 12 guest rooms, each one of a unique detailed fantasy.     The rooms have bold colours that liven up the walls, there are amazing pillars, and a special acoustic chamber for meditation.     The hotel provides superb views of the paddy fields and plantations of the coastal plains and the Arabian Sea beyond.
