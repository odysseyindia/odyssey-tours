The Manor was originally developed as a small country hotel in the 1950s; today, it is an oasis in the centre of this sprawling bustling city. The 2-storey, boutique hotel is set in landscaped gardens and has been completely redesigned as a contemporary luxury hotel. Public areas combine cool Italian mosaic flooring with warm, rich wood panelling. There is also a top-class restaurant offering a modern take on Indian food.
