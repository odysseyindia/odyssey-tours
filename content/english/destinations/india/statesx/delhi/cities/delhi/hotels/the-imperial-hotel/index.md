A delightful colonial hotel right in the centre of New Delhi. Set in tree-lined gardens with a swimming pool, the Imperial has an air of serenity and old-world opulence. The high-ceilinged rooms are furnished with classic pieces, with the flooring in wood and marble. A museum-quality collection of Raj-era art lines the corridors. In addition, The Imperial offers five excellent restaurants, and a large, historic bar.
