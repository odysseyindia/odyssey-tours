The capital Imphal (from yumpham, homestead) lies in the heart of an oval valley cut through by narrow rivers and surrounded by forested hills. The city has a large open space for a polo ground, a sport Manipuris claim to have invented. The Khwairamband Bazar is run exclusively by women. It is an excellent place for handicrafts and handloom goods, as well as vegetables, fish and other foodstuffs, jewellery and cosmetics.
