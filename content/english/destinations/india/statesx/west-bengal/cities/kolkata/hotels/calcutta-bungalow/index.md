In the heart of the Bengali part of the city that the British referred to as Black Town, is a restored 1920s townhouse, representative of a golden era in Calcutta's architecture. The delightful rooms are colourful and sprinkled with antiques, and there's a cosy common area and cafe. A great way to explore Kolkata's vibrant past - while living it at the same time!
