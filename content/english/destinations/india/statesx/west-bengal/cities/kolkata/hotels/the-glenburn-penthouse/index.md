The Glenburn Penthouse is an elegant residence in the heart of historic Kolkata, with an exquisite collection of antique Bengal colonial furniture and artworks. The Penthouse has spectacular views of Kolkata's iconic landmarks, easily enjoyed from lovely common spaces with Glenburn's own estate tea. The spacious suites have four-poster beds, and an air of Raj-era elegance. There is a library, a sun deck, even an infinity swimming pool that looks across to the Victoria Memorial.
