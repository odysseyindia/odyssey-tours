Glenburn is a beautiful tea plantation retreat above the banks of the river Rungeet, high in the Himalayas, overlooked by the mighty Kanchenjunga mountain range. Established in colonial times, it now offers a vineyard-like tea experience, where you can learn about tea in relaxed luxury, with outdoor sitouts, tea tastings, walking trails, massage treatments, fishing and more, amid lovingly restored planter's bungalows.
