Sunderbans Jungle Camp is located in the remote southern stretches of West Bengal's Gangetic Delta. Located at the edge of the world's largest mangrove eco-systems, the camp offers very special opportunities to see the flora and fauna of this UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Sunderbans Jungle Camp's cottages have mud walls and thatched roofs, but are surprisingly comfortable inside, lined with photos of the delta.
