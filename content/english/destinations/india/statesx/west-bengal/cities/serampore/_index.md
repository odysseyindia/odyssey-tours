The town of Serampore has seen plenty of history: it was once a feudal town, then a Danish colony called Frederiknagore in the 18th and 19th centuries, then one of the places that saw the Bengal Renaissance when the British started India's second ever railway line here. Today, it shows off a collection of colonial-era buildings among a variety of temples, a great place to check out Bengal's amazing past.
