Gadkhali is located in the south-eastern corner of West Bengal in India, a 3-hour drive from Kolkata. Situated just opposite to Gosaba Island, Godkhali is the place where your Sundarbans trip starts from. You take a boat from here to Sunderbans Jungle Camp from where you can explore in-depth the world's largest estuarine forest.
