Uleytokpo village is home to the family running Ule Ethnic resorts since 1974. The resort, with wood-panelled cottages and comfortable tents, is entirely solar-powered, a first for Ladakh. The resort offers pleasant amenities, like a hilltop restaurant, a library and an ayurvedic spa. There is also an apricot orchard; the resort makes its own apricot preserves, and you can join in the plucking during the harvest season.
