The grandest and most famous hotel in Leh, the Grand Dragon offers plush accommodation with spectacular views of the Himalayas. A large, modern hotel, the Grand Dragon provides contemporary facilities amid Tibetan motifs and colours, with a bakery, multi-cuisine cafe and an Oriental restaurant. Very much the place if you want to explore Ladakh in style - there are even heated floors!
