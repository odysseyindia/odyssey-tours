Nimmu House is a charming eco-resort nestled at 10,000 feet in the village of Nimmoo, 35km outside Leh. It is both a wellness retreat (offering yoga and spa therapies), and a great base to explore the Leh valley, with both traditionally-styled rooms and luxury tents in a beautiful orchard. The main building once belonged to a cousin of the Ladakhi king, and has been restored to offer cosy lounges and a great restaurant.
