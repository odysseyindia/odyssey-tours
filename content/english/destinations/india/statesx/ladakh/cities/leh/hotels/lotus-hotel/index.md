One of Leh's older hotels, Lotus Hotel is smaller, and thus more peaceful, than most. It is tastefully furnished throughout, almost resembling an old English country house. The main bazaar of Leh is just a short walk away. There is a variety of common areas to relax in - a flowering lawn out front, a closed TV lounge and a lounge with traditional floor seating. The rooms are old-fashioned, but large and quite grand.
