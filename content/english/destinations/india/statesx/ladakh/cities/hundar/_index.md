Hundar is an attractive village in the Nubra Valley, set among lots of trees and gurgling streams. It is 7km from Diskit, with its monastery on a hillock above the village. Between Hundar and Diskit lie several kilometres of sand dunes, and (two-humped) Bactrian camels graze in the "forests" of seabuckthorn. You have a unique opportunity to ride on a camel in this high-altitude desert with snow-capped mountains on the horizon.
