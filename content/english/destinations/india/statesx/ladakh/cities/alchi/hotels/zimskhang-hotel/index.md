This simple hotel is in the heart of the small village of Alchi, just 100 metres from the famous monastery. The 16 rooms are large and simply furnished, with en-suite bathrooms. There are few luxuries, though flat-screen televisions have recently been added, but in any case you may well prefer the view from the very pleasant garden restaurant.
