Rimo Hotel is a pleasant, family-run place to stay at the edge of Kyagar village. The comfortable bedrooms have attached bathrooms and are attractively decorated. The restaurant is spacious and offers tasty meals, and, before dinner, there is often a coulourful and authentic performance of local music and dance at a nearby village house.
