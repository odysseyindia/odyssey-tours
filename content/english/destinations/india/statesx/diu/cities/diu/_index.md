Like Goa and Daman, Diu was originally a Portugese colony until its accession to India in 1961. To this day, it retains a distinctive atmosphere. The town of Diu is a maze of narrow, winding streets and many of the houses are well ornamented and brightly painted. There are many interesting churches and a huge 16th- century fort built in Portuguese style. Nearby is a beautiful sandy beach at Ahmedpur Mandvi.
