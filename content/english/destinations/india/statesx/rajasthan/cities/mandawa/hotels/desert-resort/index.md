Located on the outskirts of Mandawa and overlooking fields and sand dunes, the unique and atmospheric Desert Resort is a truly original place to stay. It's a purpose-built village, with streets leading to clusters of huts and thatched pavilions from which to enjoy the surroundings. The delightful "mud huts" are surprisingly comfortable, with large modern bathrooms, and are brightly decorated with local textiles and craftwork. There is an azure swimming pool, and elaborate buffet meals are served in the cool dining room, which is decorated with shells.
