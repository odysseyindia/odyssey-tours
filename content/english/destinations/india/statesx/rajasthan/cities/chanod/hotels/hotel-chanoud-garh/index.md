This recently-restored palace offers a heritage homestay experience. The personable young owners will oversee every moment of your stay. They will show you round the property, including the museum-like Hall, and escort you to your sumptuous room. All meals are included, and are served in different atmospheric "dining locations". The owners also offer an intensive cookery class conducted by the mother of the house.
