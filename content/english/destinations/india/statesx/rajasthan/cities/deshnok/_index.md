The Karni Mata Temple in Deshnok, 30km from Bikaner on the Jodhpur road, is dedicated to a 15th-century female mystic who prophesied the foundation of the kingdom of Bikaner and has been worshipped as a reincarnation of the goddess Durga. Mice and rats, revered as reincarnated saints and fed with sweets and milk, swarm around your feet. It is not obligatory to enter if you do not like the sound of this!
