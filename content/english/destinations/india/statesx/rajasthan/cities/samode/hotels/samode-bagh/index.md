A royal-style tented resort, Samode Bagh is set in a wonderful orchard-like garden. The spacious air-conditioned tents are furnished in the Raj Shikaar style with attached marble bathrooms. There are dhurries on the floors and bright textiles, plus easy chairs outside, from where you can enjoy the beautiful gardens and the bird-life. A long line of fountains in the formal Mughal style lead to the regal swimming pool.
