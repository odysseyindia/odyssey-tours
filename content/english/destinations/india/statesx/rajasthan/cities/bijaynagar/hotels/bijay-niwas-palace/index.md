In a rural location, surrounded by orchards and fields, this grand old palace has 6 rooms in the main building, and 12 in the wing overlooking the garden. There is an enticing swimming pool, and plenty of comfortable lounges in which to relax. Dinners are served in the atmospheric dining hall, and breakfast in the garden, in the shade of the trees. The atmosphere here is one of quiet relaxation in historic surroundings.
