A 300-year old rambling place with massive ramparts, thicker than a couple of metres, the Pachewar Garh has a large lawn with a tiny family temple.     Some of the rooms here are large with enormous high arches supporting the ceilings and grand frescoes on the walls. Other rooms are smaller but brightly decorated with local furnishings. The courtyard with its lovely lawns is the place to relax. A swimming pool has recently been added too.
