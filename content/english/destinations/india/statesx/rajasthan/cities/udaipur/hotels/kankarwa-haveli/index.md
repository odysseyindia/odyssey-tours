A renovated 250-year-old haveli on the shores of Lake Pichola, in the heart of the Old City. Kankarwa Haveli is a family-run hotel with simply-decorated but surprisingly spacious rooms, many of which face the lake. Breakfast and dinners are served on the terrace from where you can enjoy impressive views over Lake Pichola, and where you can also enjoy an early morning yoga class.
