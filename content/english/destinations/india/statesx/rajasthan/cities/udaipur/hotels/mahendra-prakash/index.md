Mahendra Prakash is a haveli-style hotel in a quiet location on a shaded avenue near the Rose Garden, with the main city sights still in close proximity. It is a wonderful oasis in the busy city of Udaipur. The rooms are tastefully furnished in traditional style. After a long day of sightseeing, you can relax by the pool in the garden with a few tortoises for company. There is a good restaurant by the pool too.
