Ram Pratap Palace hotel overlooks the Fateh Sagar lake, just north of Udaipur's main attractions. It's a rambling marble mansion with pleasant, airy rooms with marble floors and lovely window seats overlooking the lake. There is a garden restaurant on the shore, which also has the hotel owner's personal vintage car collection. The hotel can arrange a drive around the lake in a vintage car, or in a horse-drawn carriage.
