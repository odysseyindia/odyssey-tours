Located just outside Udaipur, on a hill with 360-degree views, Fateh Garh is a newly built palace hotel. The breathtaking panoramic views stretch over Lake Pichola with the Lake Palace Hotel, the City Palace complex, and the magnificent hills that surround Udaipur. The rooms are a study in space, light and luxury. The predominant colour is white, and large windows bring the outside scenery right into your bedroom.
