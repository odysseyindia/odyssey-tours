Located in an orchard of rare beauty, and run by exceptionally amiable hosts, Shahpura Bagh is a real treat. This was the summer residence of the rulers of Shahpura and is now a fine heritage hotel with beautifully furnished rooms. The owners organise excursions to a nearby fort and to their eco-farm. Most guests, though, find it difficult to leave the delightful swimming pool! An ideal spot for relaxation and light activity.
