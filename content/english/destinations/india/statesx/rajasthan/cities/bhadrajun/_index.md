When the Pandava prince Arjun eloped with Krisna's sister Subhadra, it was here they came to be married, and so the place was named: Subhadra plus Arjun, its distortion accepted as its present name. While prayers are still said at this holy site, Bhadrajun's past has a history filled with skirmishes and battles, as is evident from the forts and cenotaphs in the vicinity.
