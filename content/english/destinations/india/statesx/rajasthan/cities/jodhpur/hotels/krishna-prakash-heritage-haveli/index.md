In the heart of the Old City, immediately below Meherangarh Fort, Krishna Prakash Heritage Haveli is an authentic haveli that has been converted into a heritage hotel. The present family restorated their ancestral home, taking care to retain the integrity of its original style. The hotel has 28 air-conditioned rooms with attached bathrooms. The rooftop terrace offers splendid views, especially in the evening.
