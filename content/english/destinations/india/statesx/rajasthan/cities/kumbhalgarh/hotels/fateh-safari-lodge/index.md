Perched atop a hill near the fortress of Kumbhalgarh, Fateh Safari Lodge offers cool, elegant spaces and a luxurious stay. The ochre-coloured lodge, inspired by the old royal hunting lodges of Rajasthan, offers great views over Kumbhalgarh National Park, and a huge array of paintings and sculptures within, all related to the flora and fauna of the area, particularly the leopards, bears and deer found in the sanctuary.
