A well-run royal family home. Mr Digvijay Singh and his wife Kavita have a keen eye for detail that has won them many repeat guests over the years. Located in a quiet residential area, Madhuban embodies the charm of old. The common areas and the rooms are all decorated with a classic ambience and period furniture. There is a small swimming pool, and a peaceful garden.
