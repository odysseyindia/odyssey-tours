A fabulous 19th-century palace overlooking a lake backed by green hills. Still the residence of the former royal family, there are beautiful guest rooms furnished with authentic period furniture. The beautifully-designed swimming pool borders the lake beyond and has some fabulous carved statuary around. The lake contains a small island, which houses the family temple of the owners of the palace.
