  - Morning and evening leopard safaris
---
The region around Bera is a beautiful combination of semi-desert countryside with dunes and ravines and beautiful large granite hill formations. This rock-strewn region is home to some of the more pastoral tribes of India such as the Rabaris (shephers/herdsmen). It is also the natural habitat for Indian leopards and your host at Bera is a keen leopard watcher. You can enjoy thrilling safaris in the early morning and late afternoon  to try and get a glimpse of this elusive animal.
