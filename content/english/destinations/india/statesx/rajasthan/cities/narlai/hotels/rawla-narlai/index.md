This former hunting lodge is now a charming heritage hotel. The rooms and suites are all delightfully different from each other, with local Rajasthani furniture. There is a large, well-maintained courtyard lawn bordered by flaming bougainvillea, and an immaculate swimming pool, making this a wonderful place to break your journey, and to explore the surrounding village and its attractive boulder-strewn landscape. One of the most spectacular experiences at Narlai (or anywhere) is the beautiful, lamp-lit step-well dinner, a must for a romantic stay. You can also go horse-riding, trekking or on a leopard safari; all these activities can be booked directly at the hotel.
