Chandelao Garh is a medieval fortified home converted by the sympathetic owner, Praduman Singh, into a lovely small, innovatively eco-friendly hotel. Praduman Singh has been involved in many welfare projects in his village, like the Sunder Rang crafts centre, run by village women. The rooms are traditional yet comfortable, and the food is locally grown. Staying here is a genuine eco-friendly rural experience.
