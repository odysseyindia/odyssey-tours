Godwad Safari Camp is based near Mithdi Dam, at the dam's basin area. The location is ideal for observing the terrain around and for various activities including leopard safari, walking trips, short treks, cycling/mountain biking tours and fishing. The camp consists of luxury tents, a recreational lounge and a multi-cuisine restaurant. There's a fun, safari-style atmosphere, with campfires, dinner under a banyan tree, and more.
