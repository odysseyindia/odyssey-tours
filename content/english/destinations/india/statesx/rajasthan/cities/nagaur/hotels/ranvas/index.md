Within the magnificent Ahhichatragarh Fort, lie the 18th-century residences and pleasure palace of the sixteen ranis of Maharaja Bakhat Singh of Jodhpur, across ten luxury havelis. Now one of the most well preserved queenly residences in India, Ranvas gives you fountains and peacocks, vivid frescoes and geometric gardens. Each haveli has two or three bedrooms with ensuite bathrooms and a private courtyard, and there is a swimming pool and two charming restaurants.
