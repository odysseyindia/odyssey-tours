Across the river from Hampi, in the heritage village of Anegundi, is a small but prettily landscaped boutique property called Uramma Cottages. The attractive cottages look out onto the lawn, and are distinctively furnished using local fabrics. There is a restaurant serving excellent local dishes.    The friendly staff can take guests for a stroll around the village to see the various other eco-tourism initiatives which the owners of the hotel are involved in, such as a school, library, weaving centre, and craft centre. Mountain bikes are available to explore the surrounding villages and temples, or the ruins of Hampi.
