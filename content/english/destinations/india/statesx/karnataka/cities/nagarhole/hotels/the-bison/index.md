The Bison is a boutique tented camp, situated at Nagarhole National Park, on the shores of the Kabini river. Each African-style tent is furnished with a double bed, wooden floors, beautiful artefacts like old cabin trunks, and an en-suite bathroom. There is a pool and a lovely common area to relax in. They have a good naturalist on site, and you're encouraged to switch off and just enjoy nature here.
