This hotel was originally built by the Wodeyar ruling family of Mysore, and has considerable old-world charm. Built to house the Maharaja's British guests, the building consists of rooms that still bear graceful writing desks, claw-foot bathtubs and winged armchairs. There's also a very pleasant pool area, and a nice courtyard with seating under majestic old trees, and a coffee shop, plus an atmospheric bar.
