A charming, simple resort beautifully located among paddy fields and coffee, cardamom, pepper and citrus plantations. The old planters bungalow has been extended to create more guest rooms. Delicious food is served in a garden restaurant. The owner belongs to the old planters community and is a delightful person with a wealth of knowledge of Coorg.
