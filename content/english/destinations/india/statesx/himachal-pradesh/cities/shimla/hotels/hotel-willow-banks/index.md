The Willow Banks hotel is conveniently situated on Shimla's principal walkway, the Mall. Built in 1871, it has gone through many a facelift and is now fairly modern. The rooms are bright and pleasant, centrally heated and many have an attached balcony. A central atrium ensures that sunlight fills the hotel, and there is a formal indoor dining restaurant and hipper, more casual food court outside overlooking Shimla valley.
