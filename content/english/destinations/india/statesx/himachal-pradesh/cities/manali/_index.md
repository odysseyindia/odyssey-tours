Manali is situated on the Beas river (and near its source), at the northern tip of the Kullu valley. It is a popular tourist spot for Indians in summer and a magical, snow-covered place in winter. The dense deodar slopes, fertile apple orchards, wild flowers and the awesome grandeur of the surrounding mountains make it an ideal base for short or long treks.
