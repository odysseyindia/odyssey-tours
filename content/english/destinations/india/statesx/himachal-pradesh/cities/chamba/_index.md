Picturesque Chamba, surrounded by lush forests, is on the south bank of the Iravati river, its stone houses clinging to the hillside. In the town's centre is the Chaugan, a huge expanse of meadow that is the focal point of all cultural and social life. Clustered around it are a number of imposing buildings, including the old Akhand Palace and some fine towering stone temples.
