This small, unique boutique guesthouse offers Upper Dharamsala's finest accommodation. Each of the rooms is uniquely themed according to different aspects of Tibetan culture. The furniture and murals offer a treasure chest of style and history. The hotel is in a great location, a short, though steep, walk from McLeod Ganj market and the Dalai Lama's temple, and next door to the Namgyal Monastery.
