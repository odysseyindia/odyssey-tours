Him View Guesthouse is a homely guest house, perfectly located just a few minutes walk from the centre of Mcleod Ganj. The rooms are simple but many have balconies with views over the hills. There is a courtyard and small restaurant that serves delicious home-cooked vegetarian meals. The guesthouse is run by a very friendly and helpful Tibetan family, and there are reminders of Tibet throughout.
