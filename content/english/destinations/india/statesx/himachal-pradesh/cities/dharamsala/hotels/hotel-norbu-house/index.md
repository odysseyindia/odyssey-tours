Norbu House is situated on a quiet path on the ridge facing the Dalai Lamaâ€™s temple and the stunning views which stretch for over 150 kilometres down the valley. The comfortable, spacious rooms feature Tibetan colours and motifs, and you are less than a ten-minute walk from both the main square at McLeod Ganj and the Dalai Lama's temple.
