Norling Guesthouse is located within the Norbulingka Institute in Lower Dharamsala, a 20-minute drive from McLeod Ganj. This is a warm, cosy place with lovely Tibetan art, and the beautiful grounds of the Institute and temple around it. A comfortable guesthouse, this intimate place provides access to the sacred traditional art forms of Thangka painting, applique work and wood and metal work that are practised in the institute.
