One of the first resorts in the region, Vythiri Resort is a lovely place set in a beautiful seven-acre plot of lush rain forest. There are three boulder-strewn streams flowing through it - one waterfall has created a wonderful plunge pool. Tasteful cottages, tree houses and rooms with private balconies (and some with private pools) are scattered throughout the lush area. The resort has a good sized pool, a health club, an Ayurveda centre and a restaurant serving Kerala delicacies as well as a choice of Continental cuisine.
