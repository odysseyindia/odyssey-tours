Northern Kerala is home to empty beaches fringed by coconut plantations, peaceful inland waterways and lush hillside spice gardens that still preserve an undisturbed rhythm of life.     Neeleshwar Hermitage can arrange a guided village walk or a visit to a nearby plantation. Alternatively, you can explore the nearby network of small lanes by bike. Cycle through paddy fields, past shines, temples and mosques and follow the coastline, along which lie traditional fishing villages where boats and nets are made and repaired.     It is also possible to drive Bekal, north of Neeleshwar, where you can admire the view from the top of the Bekal Fort, an outpost built by the Portuguese but later captured by the British - it still has the Victorian English park benches to prove it.
