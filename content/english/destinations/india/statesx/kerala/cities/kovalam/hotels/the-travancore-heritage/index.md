The Travancore Heritage is a seaside resort set in 8 acres of lush green coconut gardens south of Kovalam. The resort stands on a high cliff overlooking the Arabian Sea and a long, wide beach of powdery white sand. The charming cottages have elements of the traditional timber houses with tiled roofing. There is a swimming pool, Ayurveda centre, a seafood grill and a multi-cuisine restaurant.
