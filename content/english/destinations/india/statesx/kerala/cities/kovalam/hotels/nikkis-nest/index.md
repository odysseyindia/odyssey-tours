A small sea side resort nestling among lush coconut palms. Nikki's Nest is located on a hillock overlooking the white sandy beaches and the Arabian Sea. It consists of circular cottages built in ethnic style with thatched roofs, reassembled wooden Kerala houses with all modern facilities and a large independent house called "The Nest".
