The Tower House is an elegant boutique hotel housed in a historic Dutch building in the heart of Fort Cochin. Rooms have views over the park and the Chinese fishing nets along the coast. The Tower House is more like a grand old mansion rather than a hotel. It is a rambling bungalow with a roof of red tiles and a soothing whitewashed facade that conceals a well-tended lawn, a leafy courtyard and tasteful interiors.
