The Fort House is one of the older establishments on the waterfront of Fort Cochin. This atmospheric property has undergone extensive renovation and now offers over twenty pleasant rooms. The restaurant on the waterfront is a big draw - not just for its location, but also its seafood specialties. Tourists as well as Kochi residents are regular visitors here, and they come to enjoy the evening views of the harbour.
