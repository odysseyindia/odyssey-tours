This is one of the true gems of Fort Cochin. Located only a street away from the waterfront and the famous Chinese fishing nets, the Old Harbour Hotel enjoys a superb location. The Old Harbour Hotel has characterful rooms, nooks and corridors dotted with antiques, and a beautiful poolside area in the shade of huge rain trees, perfect for relaxing with a beer.
