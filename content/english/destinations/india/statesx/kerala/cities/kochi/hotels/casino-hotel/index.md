A modern 3 star hotel with an excellent seafood restaurant. Located on Willingdon Island, the Casino Hotel has 70 air-conditioned rooms and a swimming pool. The hotel is famous for its seafood restaurant which is only open in the evenings. There is no menu, just a trolley, piled high with the day's fresh catch. They cook the fish as you like it.
