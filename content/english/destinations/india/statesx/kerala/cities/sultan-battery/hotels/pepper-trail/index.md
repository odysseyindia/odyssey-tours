Set in the heart of a colonial plantation, surrounded by the tropical rainforests and lakes of Wayanad, Pepper Trail is a small but luxurious plantation stay. A serene, intimate setting, Pepper Trail offers bungalow rooms, spacious villas and even tree houses! There's a whole plantation for you to explore by jeep or on foot, a lake to go boating or fishing in, and plenty of place to navel-gaze between excellent meals.
