Tranquil is a delightful and secluded resort set in a 400 acre coffee plantation.     This sprawling 70 year old bungalow full of old-world charm has  comfortable rooms and even treehouses. Staying here with the convivial hosts is a fabulous way of getting to know plantation life, in a peaceful environment.    You can swim in the pool, lounge in a hammock, have a therapeutic Ayurvedic massage or spend a day trekking to the Edakal Caves.
