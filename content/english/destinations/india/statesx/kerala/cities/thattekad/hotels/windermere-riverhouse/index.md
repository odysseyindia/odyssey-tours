The River House echoes a stately old Colonial bungalow, on two acres of lush garden right on the banks of the Periyar River. The rooms are large, with soaring ceiling and furniture that have been customized and handcrafted on site, following the old traditions. The River House is great for birding, cycling, solitude, long walks, quiet boat-rides at sunset, a pool overlooking the water, leisurely yoga sessions and dinner under the stars.
