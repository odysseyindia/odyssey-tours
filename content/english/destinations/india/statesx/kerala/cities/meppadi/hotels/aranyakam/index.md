Aranyakam is a homestay in a coffee plantation. Overlooking hills to one side and a lush green forest on the other, the location could not be better than this. The guest rooms include simple but comfortable rooms in a double-storied heritage bungalow. There are fantastic views and verandahs from which to enjoy them, plus excellent homemade food and chatty owners.
