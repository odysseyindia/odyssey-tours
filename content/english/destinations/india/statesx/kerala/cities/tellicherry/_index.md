Tellicherry (Thalassery) was set up by the British East India Company at the end of the 17th century to export pepper and cardamom. Here, a famous fort still stands on a rocky promontory in the area. There are also some attractive old buildings, some within the Citadel. The Odathil mosque, believed to be 400 years old, is in the traditional Kerala style, with a gabled roof and copper sheeting.
