A charming, small resort with comfortably furnished, moderately-priced rooms in different, equally cosy styles, each of which has a modern bathroom and private sit-out. The building, with its red tin roof hugs the side of a hillock. There are verandahs from where one can look down on the hairpin bend in the road below, flanked by cardamom plantations.
