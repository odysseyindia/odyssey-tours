This handsome grand planter's home is now a very chic retreat belonging to the Malabar House family. Like all their other properties, Serenity combines a great home in a wonderful location, with a distinctive sense of style.    The old building makes a surprisingly grand background for the eclectic art collection, and the bold colours bring out the strong architectural features. Outside, in the sunlit garden, is a pool surrounded by trees and flowering bushes.
