The new state of Jharkhand, in what was southern Bihar, came into being in 2000. An area of great natural beauty, Jharkand comprises a forested plateau, home to a large population of tribal people with distinctive cultures.    There are game reserves set in often stunningly beautiful and remote scenery on the Chhota Nagpur plateau which can easily be reached from Ranchi, the capital of Jharkand. This is one of the poorest areas of India, with extensive missionary activity.
