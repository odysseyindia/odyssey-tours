Yangsum Farm is scenically located in idyllic countryside. The friendly owners are happy to show guests around the fully organic 44-acre farm, with its abundant vegetables, fruits, flowers and trees. There are six spacious and well-furnished bedrooms. Guided walks can be arranged through the forest to a memorial to Rabindranath Tagore and an old hilltop monastery. Delicious meals made from local produce are a highlight.
