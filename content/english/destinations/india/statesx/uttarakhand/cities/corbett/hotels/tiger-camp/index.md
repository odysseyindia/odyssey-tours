One of Corbett's older (and therefore less built-up) resorts, Tiger Camp has comfortable cottages hidden within a large garden with a lovely swimming pool and extensive lawns leading down to the Ramganga River. Buffet meals are served in the thatched roof restaurant. It is ideally located for safaris, being located close to both of the main park entry gates.
