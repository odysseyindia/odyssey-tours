A small secluded resort outside Rishikesh, the Glass House on the Ganges houses 12 exclusive rooms, set in a lychee orchard with a garden of tropical plants which attracts rare birds and butterflies. Rooms are either in the main block, fronted by a pillared veranda with relaxing planters' chairs, or in cottages in the lush gardens of mango, lychee, and citrus trees and tropical plants.
