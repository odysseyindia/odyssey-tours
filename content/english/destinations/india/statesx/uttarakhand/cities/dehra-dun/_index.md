Dehra Dun is one of the most picturesque regions in the foothills of the panoramic Shivalik ranges. Enjoyable throughout the year because of its salubrious climate, Dehra Dun is a popular spot. Once a stronghold of the Garhwal kings and later appropriated by the British as a residential resort, the town has several institutions and prestigious public schools including the Doon School, India's most exclusive private school.
