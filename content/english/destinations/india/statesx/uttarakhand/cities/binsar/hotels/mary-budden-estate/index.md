A true hideaway in the Himalayan foothills, secluded and exceptionally cosy. Mary Budden Estate is a couple of large stone and wood cottages from colonial times, converted into a relaxed, intimate resort with fabulous views and food in a setting of cedar, pine and rhododendron. A great spot if you like birding, easy treks or even just finding a good spot in the grounds or by the fire to enjoy a cuppa and a good book.
