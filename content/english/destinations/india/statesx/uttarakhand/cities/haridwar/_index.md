Ancient Haridwar is one of the seven holiest places in India, and one of the oldest living cities. It's made up of a fascinating and colourful collection of sadhus (holy men), pundits (priests), pilgrims, guides, and beggars.  The heart of the city is Har Ki Pauri, a bathing 'ghat' at the banks of the Ganges, and the lovely, bustling market around it. Every evening, the Ganges comes alive with a magical ceremony, the aarti.
