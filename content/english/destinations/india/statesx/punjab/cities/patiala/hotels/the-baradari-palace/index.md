The Baradari Palace was built in 1876 around a grand Baradari (an open pavilion with 12 arches), also giving its name to the adjacent Baradari Garden. Once the construction was finished, the ruling family of Patiala moved out of their old residence, the Qila Mubarak, and shifted to the new sprawling garden-palace. It has now been converted into a heritage hotel.
