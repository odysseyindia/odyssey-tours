One of the most tranquil and relaxing things you can do in India is to cruise through the backwaters in a Kerala houseboat, known as a kettuvallam. There is an open sitting area where you can relax and watch the world go by, sipping from a tender coconut and enjoying the sheer peace of the surroundings. Freshly cooked Indian food and chilled beer make the experience even more enjoyable.
