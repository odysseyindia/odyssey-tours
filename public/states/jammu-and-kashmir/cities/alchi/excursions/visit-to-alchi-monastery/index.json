    "content" : "<p>Most buildings in ancient India were built of wood. The Sumstek Temple, built in the 11th century at Alchi and still very much in use, is a perfect example, and shows a Hellenic influence in the Grecian engravings, while the capitals of the pillars are in the Ionic style. You&rsquo;ll see chortens here, Buddhist motifs, and a three-storey atrium, with a skylight made in an ancient style.</p>
