There are few luxuries, though flat-screen televisions have recently been added, but in any case you may well prefer the view from the very pleasant garden restaurant.</p>

The Sumstek Temple, built in the 11th century at Alchi and still very much in use, is a perfect example, and shows a Hellenic influence in the Grecian engravings, while the capitals of the pillars are in the Ionic style. You&rsquo;ll see chortens here, Buddhist motifs, and a three-storey atrium, with a skylight made in an ancient style.</p>
