    "content": 		"Aizawl (pronounced Eye-jull), the isolated capital of Mizoram, is built along a central ridge and several surrounding spurs. White-painted churches stand out above residential buildings that cling precariously to the hillsides. Built on steep slopes, Aizawl could well be the world&rsquo;s steepest capital. Houses often have front doors at street level while the backs stand precariously on stilts three times higher than their roofs.
