White-painted churches stand out above residential buildings that cling precariously to the hillsides. Built on steep slopes, Aizawl could well be the world\u0026rsquo;s steepest capital. Houses often have front doors at street level while the backs stand precariously on stilts three times higher than their roofs.\u003c/p\u003e\n"",
