Fatehpur Sikri was Emperor Akbar&rsquo;s capital for only 12 years before it was abandoned, apparently due to a lack of water. Today it is a ghost city, its architecture perfectly preserved. The white marble tomb of Sheikh Salim Chisti, Akbar&rsquo;s spiritual adviser, is a Muslim pilgrimage spot.</p>
