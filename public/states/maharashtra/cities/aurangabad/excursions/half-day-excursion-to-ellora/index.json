    "content": 		"Artists worked at the cave site of Ellora, 30km from Aurangabad, from about 600 to 1000 A.D. They created Buddhist, Hindu, and Jain caves next to each other. The masterpiece at Ellora is the astonishing temple dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva. It is the world&rsquo;s largest monolithic sculpture, carved out of one single rock cliff by 7,000 labourers over 150 years.
