Port Blair is the capital of the Andaman &amp; Nicobar Islands. This string of more than 300 almost virgin islands lies quietly in the Andaman Sea, east of the Bay of Bengal, hardly touched by modern civilization.
Recently, this idyllic tropical paradise has opened up to foreign visitors, offering exotic and relaxing holiday destinations on its beautiful palm fringed beaches and turquoise blue waters.
The islands are ringed with fine white coral sand and one only has to wade in knee-deep to enter an underwater world filled with myriad dazzling fish and corals. The best place to holiday is Havelock Island.
The Andamans also provide clear and shallow waters, perfect for scuba diving and snorkeling enthusiasts to explore!

Blessed with such a wealth of natural beauty and fertile land, Assam is a great holiday destination. From spotting rhinos at the Kaziranga National Park, to watching dancing monks at Majuli Island, and experiencing stay at a traditional tea bungalow in Jorhat or Dibrugarh, Assam has something to offer every kind of traveller!
Assam is an incredibly beautiful state with a diverse range of cultures and landscapes. It shares its borders in the North and East with the Kingdom of Bhutan and Arunachal Pradesh. Along its southern region are Nagaland, Manipur and Mizoram. Meghalaya lies to her South-West, Bengal and Bangladesh to her West.
Guwahati is the capital of Assam, strikingly located on the banks of the Brahmaputra river. Of its many mysterious temples, Kamakhya and Navagraha overlook the river, while Umananda sits marooned on an island crag.
Assam&rsquo;s magnificent Kaziranga National Park, declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO, is the home of the Indian one-horned rhinoceros. You can take jeep or an elephant safari into the park to spot the famous one-horned rhino and a wide array of other animals and birds.
Nameri National Park is much smaller than Kaziranga, but offers a very different landscape. Unlike Kaziranga&rsquo;s vast open grasslands, Nameri is comprised of deciduous forests which are home to clouded leopards, Indian bison and the rare white-winged wood duck.
Jorhat is a tea hub in the upper Assam region, with many tea estates surrounding this town. The Gymkhana Club, which was once the centre of social evenings and sports in the days of the British, is still active.
Jorhat is a good place to stay if you wish to visit Majuli, the largest river island in the world. The island, a World Heritage Site in the Brahmaputra river, is known for its rural setting, monastic retreats and traditional tribal architecture.
Dibrugarh district, in eastern Assam, is the highest producer of tea in the state, surrounded by tea estates. It is not unusual to come across green expanse of tea gardens even in the middle of the city!
Just north of Dibrugarh is Digboi, a beautiful and famous oil-town. At the spot of Asia&rsquo;s very first oil well, is now a quaint oil museum. Since there was a prominent presence of British oil personnel, many of their distinct styled bungalows still remain.
IMPORTANT Entry permits aren&rsquo;t required for Indians or foreigners.

    "content": 		"One of the least visited states of North India, Bihar is in fact an important place in the history of Indian civilization, as the birthplace of Buddhism - for it was here, at Bodh Gaya, that the Buddha gained enlightenment.
Major sites associated with the life and teachings of the Buddha, such as Bodh Gaya, Nalanda, Rajgir, and Vaishali, lie in the dry plains of central Bihar and are the main attractions for visitors.
The birthplace of Buddhism in India, Bihar occupies an important place in India&rsquo;s cultural and spiritual history. Siddhartha Gautama, the Buddha, spent much of his life here and attained enlightenment beneath a bodhi tree at Bodhgaya making it the most significant Buddhist pilgrimage site in the world.
Following a trail of ancient and modern Buddhist sites, you can visit the many shrines and temples at Rajgir, the extensive ruins of nearby Nalanda, one of the ancient worldÂs first universities, and the great Ashokan pillar at Vaishali.
Whilst Bihar has a reputation in India for extreme poverty, the infrastructure has improved markedly in the past few years, and there are now comfortable hotels, good roads, and a surprisingly wide range of food options.
These improvements have taken place to cater to the groups of pilgrims which travel from Buddhist countries throughout Asia to worship at the many Buddhist sites, leading to a peaceful, pleasant and colourful atmosphere at these places, which are mostly located in quiet rural areas surrounded by attractive farmland.
The capital city, Patna, lies in complete contrast to this, in the centre of the state. It is a busy congested city, on the banks of the River Ganges, with a fascinating jumble of crumbling colonial architecture, including one of the best Archaeological Museums in the country, bustling markets, chaotic traffic jams, and all the other facets of a fast growing Indian city.
Even though the hotel standards are good it is important to keep in mind that most are clearly designed for Asian pilgrimage groups, and none have any real character or individuality. Food is excellent - surprsingly non-veg is available almost everywhere. There is alcohol too, but most bars are in the top hotels and are expensive.
There are not any obvious security issues for travellers, though it is still advisable to avoid driving after dark, and walking around Patna after the markets and shops have closed in the evening would not be a good idea.

Chandigarh is also famous for its tree-lined avenues, giving it a unique atmosphere and charm especially during spring.
In complete contrast to the historical cities surrounding it, Chandigarh is a product of modern creation. Designed in the 1950s by the European architect Le Corbusier and built to serve as the new capital of the states of Punjab and Haryana, this is a city unlike any other.
Designed on a grid and divided into 57 different blocks or sectors it is spacious, well organised, clean, prosperous, and renowned for its gardens, particularly the still unfinished Rock Garden. Trees and plants are as much a part of the construction plans as the buildings and the roads, making Chandigarh a pleasure to visit.

The medieval atmosphere of the bazaars of Old Delhi contrasts sharply with the open, spacious streets of New Delhi, the imperial city created as the capital of India by the British.
When the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan decided to move back from Agra to Delhi in 1638, he built within 10 years the huge city of Shah Jahanabad, now known as Old Delhi. The main street is Chandni Chowk, a fascinating bustling jumble of craft shops, traders, mosques and temples.
The chief attraction of Old Delhi is the fort that contains within it opulent palaces and impressive public buildings. Most of it was built out of red (lal) sandstone, hence the name Lal Quila (Red Fort), the same as the fort at Agra on which the Delhi fort is modeled.
Near the Red Fort is the magnificent Jama Masjid, the largest mosque in India, where the faithful stream in and out from the surrounding bazaars.
In New Delhi you find the India Gate, a war memorial arch, the impressive Parliament Building and the Rashtrapati Bhawan, once the imperial palace of the British viceroy and now the official residence of the President of India.
To the South, are the Qutab Minar complex and Humayun&rsquo;s Tomb, both World Heritage Sites. The Qutab Minar has a 5-storey, 72-metre victory tower of red sandstone. Humayun&rsquo;s Tomb is a sandstone mausoleum built in proper Mughal style. The Taj Mahal, built much later, follows a similar style of architecture.

Diu was a seaport and naval base of considerable strategic importance from the 14th to 16th centuries. It was also a vital trade link with the rest of India for overseas traders.
The island of Diu though geographically a part of Gujarat, is an independent entity.
Like Goa and Daman, Diu was originally a Portuguese colony until its accession to India in 1961. However, to this day, it retains a very distinctive atmosphere.
The town is a maze of narrow, winding streets and many of the houses are well ornamented and brightly painted. There are a number of interesting churches and a huge 16th century fort built in a Christian Portuguese style. Nearby is a beautiful sandy beach at Ahmedpur Mandvi.
Diu is a favourite holiday destination for people from the neighbouring dry state of Gujarat - alcohol is available here!

One can drive through peaceful towns with their Portuguese style bungalows, stop at a small taverna for a drink of feni, or bask for hours on the pristine beaches.
The former Portuguese colony of Goa boasts a coastline with some of the world&rsquo;s most beautiful beaches, palm fringed rivers moving lazily down to the Arabian Sea, lush scenery with paddy fields, mango groves, white washed villas and easy-going, warm and hospitable people.
Panjim, the capital of Goa, is the smallest and most pleasant of state capitals. The old town has still preserved its Portuguese heritage remarkably well with several traditional Goan houses still featuring the overhanging balconies and red-tiled roofs, white-washed churches and numerous small cafes and bars.
In Old Goa, the churches of the St Cathedral, Basilica of Bom Jesus and the St Francis Church are outstanding monuments to the legacy left behind by the Portuguese.
These days, Goa&rsquo;s easy-going ambience, good food, and lovely climate have made it one of the most popular beach destinations in India to unwind.

Fascinating archeological sites, Jain, Hindu and Islamic architecture, a wide variety of scenery, exquisite crafts, rare wildlife, and some beautiful beaches are among Gujarat&rsquo;s attractions.
In the crisscrossing lanes of Ahmedabad&rsquo;s Old City, hundred year old carved wooden doorways, colourful bird feeders, and a plethora of mosques represent some of the many different facets of this city.
A short drive from Ahmedabad is the Little Rann of Kutch, a salty marsh, which was at one time an area completely submerged under the Arabian Sea. Its unique eco-system is home to the gentle Asiatic Wild Ass as well as hundreds of migratory birds including flamingos. Accommodation in the nearby village of Dasada consists of traditional mud houses and stone cottages that reveal a glimpse of a truly tribal culture.
Further to the west is the Great Rann of Kutch. Bhuj is another major town in this area, known for created by master weavers who use centuries-old methods and designs to create masterpieces of embroidery and block printed fabrics.
Just north of Bhuj is the village of Hodka. You can stay here at the Sham-e-Sarhad Resort which was designed to provide employment to locals as well as to preserve and showcase local handicrafts, cuisine and music.
For true birders there cannot be a more rewarding place than the Great Rann of Kutch, with its varied landscapes of thorn jungles, grassy bets, and the golden sandstone beds of seasonal rivers. The Grey Hypocolius visits here as do other 350 species of birds. Simple accommodation is available at Moti Virani.
Driving down the coast you reach Mandvi. Smooth sand beaches stretch without interruption, and in the distance hand made wooden boats set their course for distant lands, just as they have for hundreds of years. Here, you can stay in luxury tented accommodation.
In the centre of the Saurashtra peninsula, you can experience the lifestyle of the Maharajas circa the 1800&rsquo;s by staying in the palaces of Wankaner and Gondal. The immense influence that the royalty had on the life of the common people here is still visible.
Just south of Gondal is the Sasangir National Park where you can on safari in search of the Asiatic Lion, one of the last refuges of this magnificent beast.
Finally, you can take the 3,500 steps up to the pilgrimage site of Palitana which is surely one of the world&rsquo;s most exquisite temple complexes. Accommodation options include two beautifully restored palaces, one in Palitana and one in the nearby Bhavnagar.

Haryana also surrounds Delhi on three sides, forming the northern, western and southern borders of Delhi. Consequently, a large part of Haryana is included in the National Capital Region.
Haryana has the 3rd highest per capita income in the country. It is one of India&rsquo;s most industrialized states, and is considered to be the current growth engine of India, with the city of Gurgaon rapidly emerging as a major hub for the information technology and automobile industries.
Gurgaon is considered a new satellite town of Delhi, situated just south of the city and close to Delhi&rsquo;s International and Domestic Airports. The city has grown extensively during the last decade and has become one of the most prominent outsourcing and off shoring hubs in South Asia.
The outsourcing boom has led to a demographic shift to a younger, more cosmopolitan, more affluent and well-educated population. This in turn has stimulated a mushrooming of shopping malls, up-market restaurants and entertainment facilities.
The capital of the state is Chandigarh which is administered as a union territory and is also the capital of Punjab.

    "content": 		"Himachal Pradesh is India&rsquo;s most popular and easily accessible hill state. The snowy mountains and steep hillsides have ensured that the region has remained an idyllic place, little touched by the fast changing world around it.
Visit Himachal Pradesh for its spectacular vistas of snowy mountains, its Raj-era picturesque hill stations, its dignified Tibetan Buddhist temples and its wonderfully warm people.
The state capital Shimla, was also the British summer capital of India. It is therefore the epitome of all that the British would crave in the summer heat - refreshing temperatures, wooded hillsides, churches to visit on Sundays, and of course a warm hearth by which to sip a peg or two in the evenings.
North of Shimla, past homely stone cottages and apple orchards, is Manali. Manali&rsquo;s distinctive wooden temples, the colourful hats and vests of its villagers and its superb culinary offerings make it a much sought after destination. The town also has some lovely accommodation options built in the style of traditional Manali homes.
Travelling north from Manali, the roads climbs through the Rohtang Pass into Lahul and on to Leh. The journey is best done with a night halt at Jispa, a pleasant little hamlet, 21 km north of Keylong. This is an extraordinary journey on the second highest motorable road in the world, usually open only from early June to early October.
To the west of Manali lies Dharamsala. The little scoop in the Dhauladhar Mountains that is Dharamsala is the seat of the Dalai Lama in exile, as well as a place of refuge of many Tibetans. It is both a deeply religious place, as well as the vibrant and colourful home of a people that refuse to be crushed in spite of the hardships they bear.
The perfectly preserved stone and brick houses of Pragpur are just over two hours' drive from Dharamsala. This 16th century heritage village is set in the fruit and flower filled Kangra Valley. Pragpur also presents the opportunity to stay in a beautiful turn of the century country manor.
The tea estates of Palampur are close by. Palampur&rsquo;s misty hillsides and clear views of snow-capped mountains make it an ideal place for a quiet overnight stopover, staying in cottages on a tea estate or in the grander Taragarh Palace.
A breath taking drive heading north-west past terraced fields brings you to the unconsciously beautiful temples of Chamba. Chamba is also famous for its intricately embroidered roomals (handkerchiefs) and for its miniature paintings, both of which can be admired in the Bhuri Singh museum.
Built over eight hills, the once immensely popular hill station of Dalhousie is now a much quieter place with local fruit and vegetable markets and a couple of Romanesque churches. Ruby red rhododendrons fill the valleys their own in summer. A night in the Grand View Hotel, one of Dalhousie&rsquo;s best preserved wood and stone buildings adds greatly to the experience.

Jammu and Kashmir is India&rsquo;s northernmost state, bordering Pakistan, and China&rsquo;s Tibetan plateau. It&rsquo;s three distinct regions - Jammu, the Kashmir Valley and Ladakh - offer a rich diversity of landscapes, religions and people.
Jammu is predominantly Hindu. Encompassing plains, mountains and foothills, Jammu boasts the famous hilltop shrine of Vaishno Devi, an important pilgrimage site for Hindus.
Lush and mountainous, the predominantly Muslim Kashmir Valley is a mosaic of forests, rice fields, lakes and waterways. Tragically, the state has been out of bounds for travellers for almost two decades as a result of an armed insurgency by Kashmiri separatists. Today, however, calm is returning and travellers are again flocking to stay on the famous houseboats on the lakes of Srinagar.
Ladakh, the far-flung eastern corner of Jammu &amp; Kashmir state, has an almost moon-like barren landscape interspersed by the green of oasis villages with monasteries and ancient palaces perched on lofty hilltops.
The friendly Ladakhis have preserved their Tibetan culture and religion which is now hard to find in Tibet itself, making Ladakh one of the world&rsquo;s most remote corners of Buddhism.
Leh, Ladakh&rsquo;s capital, is built into the base of the snow-covered Karakoram range. It is a sprawling city at the foot of the nine-storey Tibetan-style Palace. In the past Leh used to be an important stop on the Silk route in Asia. Nowadays it is an important strategic centre for India as well as an important base for travellers to explore the rest of Ladakh.
After acclimatising to the altitude, you can use Leh as a base for making short trips to the adjoining valleys. You need one full day to explore the Indus Valley gompas of Shey, Tikse &amp; Hemis. The Hemis monastery is the biggest and wealthiest monastery in Ladakh. Colourful flags flutter in the breeze from the four pillars in the courtyard.
You can also enjoy a white-water rafting excursion on the Indus or Zanskar rivers. The rafting is easy but floating in a rubber inflatable raft is a hugely enjoyable way to experience the valley&rsquo;s rugged and beautiful landscape. The season only lasts from early July to mid-September.
A visit to Ladakh is not complete without enjoying home hiking. The 4 day trek from Likir to Lamayura is a good introduction to trekking in Ladakh as it is at relatively low altitude, whilst the walking is fairly gentle with plenty of time to enjoy the views. July and August are the most pleasant months, and also most favourable for trekking. September and October are also good, but teamperatures get colder at night.

There are game reserves set in often stunningly beautiful and remote scenery on the Chhota Nagpur plateau which can easily be reached from Ranchi, the capital of Jharkand. This is one of the poorest areas of India, with extensive missionary activity.
The capital of the newly formed state of Jharkhand, Ranchi is a good base from which to explore the natural beauty of the Chhota Nagpur Plateau.
Ranchi is a pleasant, friendly city, which provides a fascinating insight into the way in which India is progressing, with it&rsquo;s juxtaposition of modern shopping malls and traditional market places. The Mian Road market in particular is a photographer&rsquo;s paradise.
Jharkhand is well known for its waterfalls, found throughout the state where the many rivers descend from the plateau to the lowlands. The best are located a couple of hours drive to the east of Ranchi.
Many areas to the west of Ranchi especially on the heavily forested Chhota Nagpur plateau, have been designated as areas for the protection of wildlife. The most accessible of these is the Betla National Park in the Palamau Sanctuary. Here you can take safaris by jeep or by elephant in search of the abundant wildlife, and can also visit tribal villages.
Whilst driving in Jharkhand you may be lucky enough to come across one of the weekly tribal markets. These are well worth exploring, and you will be made to feel very welcome!
Very few foreigners visit Jharkhand, and indeed the infrastructure can be very limited outside of Ranchi - not much English is spoken, power cuts are frequent, and the food, whilst plentiful, may lack variety - but these limitations are more than made up for by the opportunity to visit a part of India which remains deeply traditional.
The scenery is stunning, and the people very friendly and helpful. There is none of the harassment which can sometimes mar visits to more &ldquo;popular&rdquo; parts of India, and photographers will be particularly impressed with the opportunities to capture the life of this unspoilt part of the country.

Kodagu (Coorg), is a picturesque region best known for its coffee estates and spice plantations.

You can stay here in a 100-year old mansion in Virajpet or in Orange County, a modern luxury plantation resort in Siddhapura.
North of Bangalore is Hospet, a district town in central Karnataka, just 13 km from Hampi, the site of the capital of the Vijayanagar empire, which rivaled Rome in the 16th century. Today, the extensive ruins evoke the history of a very advanced civilization. Moreover, the landscape is remarkable, miles of barren land dotted with gigantic boulders standing against the blue skies.
A few hours' drive north of Hampi are the sleepy villages of Badami, Pattadakal and Aihole, once the capital cities of the Chalukyas who ruled much of the Deccan between the 4th and 8th centuries. They built an astonishing profusion of temples, many of which are still in a remarkable state of preservation.

The major cities of Kerala are Kozhikode in the north, Kochi in the centre, and Thiruvananthapuram in the south. They are smaller and more relaxing in comparison to most other Indian cities.
The beaches are never far away. Thiruvananthapuram, the capital of Kerala, is a convenient gateway to the palm-fringed beaches of Kovalam and Varkala. South of Kochi is a beautiful white stretch of beach at Mararikulam. Kozhikode has lovely beaches to the north such as at Neeleshwar.
For visitors, the most popular city is undoubtedly the great port of Kochi. Traders from all over the world have left their mark on the architecture here, making Kochi one of the most unique and fascinating towns in India. Walking around the old atmospheric quarters of Matancherry and Fort Cochin is a great delight.
The greatest joy of travelling in Kerala is exploring the backwaters south of Kochi, a network of waterways which weave through villages set amidst lush vegetation. There are lots of interesting home-stays and small atmospheric hotels in and around Allapuzha and Kumarakom. Alternatively, you can cruise through the backwaters in a converted rice barge (the so-called &ldquo;houseboats&rdquo;).
Roads leading further inland pass through spice, tea, coffee and rubber plantations, and natural forests, en route to wildlife reserves such as the Thattekkad Bird Sanctuary near Kothamangalam, the Eravikulam National Park near Munnar, and the Periyar National Park near Thekkady. The beauty of these green hills is unique to Kerala.
One of the most beautiful landscapes in Kerala is in Wayanad district, in the north of the state. Here you find an unbelievably beautiful combination of paddy fields, spice plantations and rain forests, creating a rich verdant atmosphere. There are some wonderful accommodation options in small places like Sultan Battery, Vythiri and Meppadi.
There are special home-stays all over Kerala but some highlights are Ayisha Manzil in Tellicherry, a beautiful bungalow overlooking the sea, Kandath Tharavad, a 100-year old traditional Kerala house in Pallakad, and Vanilla Country in Teekoy, a wonderful home right at the heart of a working plantation of vanilla, coffee and rubber.

The jewel of the Lakshadweep is Bangaram Island. A teardrop shaped, uninhabited island where there are no intrusions from the everyday world. No televisions, no telephone or newspapers. This is the perfect place to relax or to discover the myriad forms of undersea life by snorkeling or scuba diving.
The Lakshadweep Administration has stopped issuing entry permit to visit the Lakshadweep Islands from 01 November 2011 onwards.
Bangaram Island Resort is no more operational due to a legal tussle with the Lakshadweep Administration over the ownership of the resort, and the case is currently in the Supreme Court of India.
As a result, travel to the Lakshadweep Islands is NOT possible for tourists at the moment.
The only other option for Scuba diving holidays / Island Vacations is the Andaman Islands.

To the state&rsquo;s north are the famous Khajuraho temples, while eastern Madhya Pradesh has two of India&rsquo;s finest game sanctuaries, Bandhavgarh and Kanha. The scenic Malwa plateau in the southwest has the great Buddhist stupa of Sanchi and the romantic ghost-town of Mandu.
Bhopal, the capital of Madhya Pradesh, is a sprawling and historic city. It is also a convenient base for visiting the stupas and abandoned monasteries of Sanchi, one of the most important Buddhist sites in India. Other places of interest are the cave shrines of Udaigiri and the prehistoric cave paintings of Bhimbetka.
The other major city of Madhya Pradesh is Indore, situated a few hours drive south of Bhopal. There are some old palaces worth visiting in Indore but the city is more important as a gateway to the fascinating hill city of Mandu and the nearby temple towns of Omkareshwar and Maheshwar.
Northern Madhya Pradesh also has a wide variety of diverse attractions. Foremost among them is the hill-fort at Gwalior. In addition to the immaculately restored palaces and ancient Hindu temples within the fort itself, the old town of Gwalior also boasts of the kitsch 19th century Jai Vilas Palace belonging to the local ruling family, the Scindias.
En route from Agra to Khajuraho, is the tiny village of Orchha. During the 16th and 17th centuries this was the capital of the Bundela dynasty who built a fort palace on a small island on a bend in the river, later followed by other magnificent fortifications, palaces and temples. The deserted medieval town is an architectural gem not to be missed.
Khajuraho, a tiny village in the north of Madhya Pradesh, is world renowned for its temples representing the finest art and architecture of medieval India. These temples were built in a short span of a hundred years between 950 to 1050 A.D. They have achieved most of their fame for the erotic sculptures.
In addition to its historic sites, Madhya Pradesh boasts the finest wildlife reserves on the subcontinent. The Bandhavgarh National Park is one of the best places in India to spot a tiger but it also has a wide range of other game such as nilgai, jungle cat, wild boar, hyenas and many species of birdlife.
Kanha National Park is another reserve where you have a good chance of sighting tigers. Amongst the other wildlife you may see leopards, Indian bison, sambhar, blackbuck and wild dogs. Kanha has also a rich variety of bird life with 230 species recorded. You can explore this fabulous sanctuary by jeep and on elephant back.

Mumbai (formerly Bombay) is the financial, commercial and industrial capital of India. The city is also the centre of fashion and film making in modern India. As such the city hums with activity and its 13 million+ residents seem to be constantly on the move.
Mumbai used to be just a collection of fishing villages. The real development commenced only after the British East India Company took over the settlements from the Portuguese. Hence most of the historical monuments such as the Gateway of India are relics from the British Raj.
Aurangabad, named after the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb, is the gateway to the World Heritage Sites of Ajanta and Ellora. These complexes of caves are excellent examples of rock cut architecture. Ellora is the site of stunning Buddhist, Hindu and Jain cave temples, built by artists from the 6th century A.D. till about 1000 A.D.
A site worth visiting in Aurangabad itself is the Bibi ka Maqbara, built by Azam Shah in 1678 to rival the world famous Taj Mahal in Agra. Just to the north is the magnificent hilltop fortress of Daulatabad.

Manipur is also home to the Loktak Lake, the largest fresh water lake in the north-east region. Much of it falls within the Keibuk Lamjao National Park. This park has a small population of &lsquo;dancing deer&rsquo;, the endangered brow-antlered deer.
Nesting in the hills of the north east of India, Manipur is bordered by Nagaland in the north, Mizoram in the south and Assam in the west. In the east it shares an international border with Burma (Myanmar).
The capital Imphal (from yumpham, homestead) lies in the heart of an oval shaped valley cut through by narrow rivers and surrounded by forested hills. The city has a large open space for the polo ground, a sport Manipuris claim to have invented.
Manipur has always been quite independent of its neighbouring tribal areas. However, the rulers of Manipur had to indulge in constant warfare with Burma. In 1826, the British took control of Manipur after signing the Treaty of Yandaboo with the Burmese.
In 1939 a remarkable women&rsquo;s social revolt led to government action against monopolistic traders. The role of women traders can be seen most colourfully in Imphal&rsquo;s women&rsquo;s market.
During the Second World War most of Manipur was occupied by the Japanese, with 250,000 British and Indian troops trapped under siege in Imphal for three months. After India&rsquo;s independence, Manipur was first made a Union Territory and subsequently achieved statehood in 1972.
The majority of the population belongs to the Meithe tribe who lives in the valleys and is related to the Shans of Burma. The tribe has created in isolation, their own fascinating version of Vaishnavite Hinduism. The 20 or so hill-tribes who constitute about a third of the population are Christian.
Manipur has recently begun taking steps to develop its tourist potential, which is essential as the state struggles to overcome poverty in rural areas and rebellions between ethnic groups, particularly between Kukis and Nagas.
IMPORTANT In a move widely welcomed, the policy which requires special permits for travel in some areas of North East India has been dissolved as of 1 January, 2011. Now, only a valid visa is necessary for tourists visiting Manipur, Mizoram and Nagaland. However, travel to Arunachal Pradesh will still

    "content": 		"Meghalaya is one of north-east India&rsquo;s most attractive states. It has a wealth of rolling green, thickly forested hills that nurture an amazing ecological diversity, populated by tribal groups who follow a matrilineal system of inheritance.
Meghalaya&rsquo;s capital Shillong presents quite a contrast to the easy going tribal village lifestyle. Hip and happening with its fancy shops and eateries, Shillong is a pulsating hill town whose local bands offer the latest in rock and rap.
The charming hill station of Shillong is the capital of Meghalaya. The city spreads on hills covered with English-style country houses. Shillong&rsquo;s Golf Course is considered one of the best in India. It is situated in the center of the city, close to the polo ground.
56 km from Shillong, high up in the hills, is Cherrapunji, one of the rainiest places in the world. It is a pleasant drive from Shillong, with several places to stop and see roaring waterfalls leaping into deep gorges, such as the famed Nohsngithiang Falls. Sohra is the original Khasi name for Cherrapunji.
Eastern and Central Meghalaya are mainly populated by the closely related Jaintia, Pnar and Khasi peoples, originally migrants from Southeast Asia. Western Meghalaya is home to the Garo tribe, belonging to the Bodo family of the Tibeto-Burman race, said to have migrated from Tibet.
Despite their different ethnic backgrounds, these two groups both use a matrilineal system of inheritance. Descent is traced through the mother, but the father plays an important role in the life of the family. In the Khasi society, the woman looks after home and hearth, the man finds the means to support the family, and the maternal uncle settles all social and religious matters.
In the Khasi society, it is only the youngest daughter who is eligible to inherit the ancestral property. If the mother dies without any daughter surviving her, her next elder sister inherits the ancestral property, and after her, the youngest daughter of that sister. Failing all daughters and their female issues, the property goes back to the mother&rsquo;s sister, mother&rsquo;s sister&rsquo;s daughter and so on.
Many Khasi women wear a dress called &lsquo;Jainsem&rsquo; which flows loose to the ankles. The upper part of her body is clad in a blouse. Over these, she ties both ends of a checkered cotton cloth on one shoulder, thus improvising on an apron.
The staple food of Khasis is rice. They also eat fish and meat. Like the other tribes in the North-East, the Khasis also ferment rice-beer, and make spirit out of rice or millets by distillation. Use of rice-beer is a must for every ceremonial and religious occasion.
Weaving is an ancient craft of the tribals of Meghalaya - be it weaving of cane or cloth. The Khasis are famous for weaving cane mat, stools and baskets.
The Khasis are now mostly Christians. But before that, they believed in a Supreme Being, The Creator - and under Him, there were several Gods of water and of mountains and other natural objects. It is still customary for Khasis to sacrifice chickens and goats at an annual festival to ensure the return of the sun.
In the Khasi Hills are a number of ancient monoliths and table stones, which are either memorials where the ashes of the dead are deposited in cairns or cenotaphs, commemorating memorable events.
Local Khasi `monarchies' are still nominally ruled by a syiem (traditional ruler). Although they might lack political power, the main Syiems remain a considerable economic force.
IMPORTANT Entry permits aren&rsquo;t required for Indians or foreigners.

This is sure to change in the future as Mizoram is a very attractive state with a friendly a very hospitable population, a wide array of festivals and dances, handicrafts, flora and fauna, breathtaking natural beauty and temperate climate.
Mizoram is hilly region with at least 80% of the area under lush green forest and bamboo groves. The state is home to eight Wildlife Sanctuaries and two National Parks.
The Mizos are well known for their handloom and bamboo handicrafts which are still carried out in the traditional way. Mizo women are known to weave traditional textiles from the comfort of their homes, and sell them at the Bara bazaar in Aizawl. Mizo men are on the other hand expert craftsmen, working on cane and bamboo.
Aizawl is the state&rsquo;s largest city, but still very remote. It is a lively place with quaint timber houses and interesting-looking churches. Each house has its own window box of profusely blooming orchids. The streets echo with melodies emanating from the guitars of Aizawl youth playing at nearly every street corner.
Oral tradition reveals (there is no known recorded history) that the Mizos migrated from their homeland in China about 3 centuries ago, in search of new pastures and settled in these remote Mizo Hills (Lushai Hills). The Mizos were animists, believing in good and evil spirits of the woodland.
From the 19th Century, the Christian Missionaries have played a dominating role in the State, 85.73% of the population are Christians and are greatly responsible for the westernization of its social life. English is one of the commonly spoken languages.
The Mizo have an egalitarian society having no class or distinction based on caste, religion or gender. Today, Mizoram enjoys 87 percent literacy (second highest in India- a fact in which every Mizo takes genuine pride).
There has also been a concerted effort though by the young to propagate their ancient cultural strains by clinging to their traditional roots resulting in bringing to the limelight some of the most vibrant ancient Mizo traditions, cultural heritage and colourful customs.
The spring festival of Chapchar Kut is the most important in Mizoram. The festival occurs in March and men and women of all ages dressed in traditional and colourful costumes, exotic headgears and jewellery, to assemble and perform various folk dances. They also sing traditional songs accompanied by beating of drums, gongs and cymbals.

    "content": 		"Nagaland is a narrow strip of mountain territory with a long border with Myanmar to the east.
While Nagaland is mainly known for its green valleys, meandering streams, high mountains and rich variety of flora and fauna, the main attraction of Nagaland is the remote geographical location with 16 different major tribes.
Nagaland offers an opportunity to get a glimpse of a life far removed from ours.
Nagaland is a land of picture post card landscapes, lush and verdant flora, inhabited by 16 major tribes, who have hundreds of years of tradition as valiant warriors.
For centuries the tribes fiercely fought off any intruders and, in between, kept themselves busy by fighting each other. The antagonistic tribes were also geographically isolated from each other by steep mountain ridges, rivers and gorges, and have therefore retained their distinct cultural identities and languages. Today they communicate with each other in &lsquo;Nagamese&rsquo; (a sort of market Assamese), or use English.
The Nagas are famous, because only some 50-60 years ago they were still headhunters (although there are also reports about rather recent head hunts). The Nagas needed human skulls, because they believed that only with these skulls they could guarantee the fertility of the fields and the people. Only a successful headhunter was allowed to tattoo his face and body, and as a demonstration he could wear a brass head on a necklace for each head that he had seized.
Most Naga villages are perched defensively on top of ridge tops guarded by ceremonial gates. The morung, a meeting house, acts as a boys' dormitory, and is used for storing weapons and once displayed the prizes of war (enemy heads). The huge sacred drum which stands by each morung is a hollowed out trea trunk carved to resemble a buffalo&rsquo;s head.
In the old days the villageÂ´s chieftain, the Angh, built his house at the highest point. Then the missionaries came and converted Nagaland into a state with more than 90% Christians. They demonstrated their power by building churches heights greater than the AnghÂ´s house.
Originally, although they revered natural &lsquo;spirits&rsquo;, the Nagas believed in a single overseeing but unknown superforce, and hence readily accepted the Christian Gospel quite readily. The bible was translated into many of the Naga dialects (nearly every village has a church), yet the people have retained many of their old customs.
The Nagas have changed their tribal ways over time, though. One cannot expect to see people dressed in tribal clothes everywhere because a lot of people have adopted the western code of dress. Tribal costumes are usually only worn on festivals and other special occasions. Nagaland is fast modernizing but the Nagas still retain their tribal culture and values.
Dimapur is the commercial center of Nagaland, and the main entry point into the state. Nagaland&rsquo;s only airport is located there, with flights to and from Kolkata and Guwahati. Dimapur is also the only city in Nagaland to be connected by train with the rest of India.
Kohima, the state&rsquo;s capital, and the tribal villages of Khonoma and Touphema are the main places of interest in the Kohima district of Nagaland. The big traditional Hornbill Festival is held in the first week of December with various Naga tribes converging for a week-long cultural, dance and sporting celebration, much of it in full warrior costume.
Mokokchung town is the third most important urban hub in Nagaland. It takes around six hours to get there from the Nagaland capital, Kohima but Jorhat, in Assam, is exactly half the distance away. The district is home to the Ao tribe, which holds their celebratory Moatsu Festival during the first week of May each year.
You can find traditional Nagaland particularly in remote villages in the Mon district of northern Nagaland. The town of Mon itself is not especially an attraction but it is a perfect base for visiting nearby Konyak villages where you can still find elderly men with tattooed faces, feathered head gear and traditional dresses.

Add to this the long sandy beach at Puri, with its distinctive green/blue waters, and you will find Orissa an unusual but worthwhile destination.
Bhubaneswar, the capital of the state of Orissa, is a pleasant city containing a real contrast between the modern new buildings and the superb Hindu temples, many dating from back a 1000 years or more. More than 400 temples remain of the 7,000 that are said to have once embellished the city. The most famous is the Lingaraj Temple.
Puri is a popular seaside resort, famous for the great &lsquo;Car Festival&rsquo; held at the Temple of Jagannath in June or July. During this festival, the image of Jagannath is placed on an enormous 15m high wooden chariot and drawn through the streets by thousands of penitent devotees.
The splendid Sun temple of Konarak, built in the 13th century and located about 35 km from Puri, is the finest example of ancient Orissan temple architecture. The temple was conceived in the form of a colossal chariot for the sun god Surya, standing on 12 pairs of eight-spoke-wheels and drawn by seven galloping horses.
Just 20 minutes drive from Puri is the idyllic village of Raghurajpur, where every thatch-roof dwelling houses a family of artisans. Their skills in stone-and-wood carving, palm-leaf paintings, and fine drawings on silk or cloth, are passed down from one generation to the next. If you&rsquo;re interested, the artisans will demonstrate their processes.
You can take an excursion from either Puri or Bhubaneswar to Chilika, Asia&rsquo;s largest saltwater lake. Chilika lake is dotted with islands and is known for the many migratory birds which flock to the nesting sanctuary here in winter. The shallow lake is about 70 km wide and averages 15 km wide. It&rsquo;s separated from the sea only by a narrow sand bar.

In many of these castles, palaces and mansions, the erstwhile royal families still keep their residence, allowing a more personal insight into the living history that is all around you.
The pink city of Jaipur is one of the most interesting cities in India with exuberant 18th and 19th century palaces and an exotic street life. Within the walls of the Old City life continues much as it has for the last few hundred years and you can watch craftsmen such as carpet weavers and silversmiths continuing the traditions of their ancestors.
Most towns and cities in Rajasthan grew around strategic forts. Jodhpur is dominated by the massive Meherangarh Fort and Jaisalmer by its golden sandstone fortress. Aside from their impressive stalwart ramparts, the forts of Bundi and Kota also feature palaces covered with delicate miniature frescoes.
Other cities such as Bikaner, Mandawa and Nawalgarh developed because of their important location on the camel trade from central Asia to the east. Nowadays the camel caravans have stopped but you can still ride camels on the golden sands of Osian where you will sleep in luxury tents under clear, starlit skies.
There are impressive forts and castles in Bambora, Neemrana, Roopangarh, opulent palaces in Deogarh, Dungarpur and Samode, and beautiful old mansions such as in Shahpura. Nowadays many of these stunning examples of the royal past of India have been converted into beautiful heritage hotels.
The abstemious Jain religion flourished in the arid deserts of Rajasthan and its wealthy followers gave away many of their riches for the construction of glorious temples in white marble in Ranakpur, Mount Abu, and Delwara.
Water bodies are considered sacred in most parts of India but in the porous sands of Rajasthan they take on a special significance as in the case of the desert oasis of Pushkar and the romantic lake city of Udaipur.
Once one of the most popular places for a shikaar (hunt) during the British Raj, Rajasthan&rsquo;s parks and sanctuaries now attract a large number of wildlife enthusiasts. Sawai Madhopur&rsquo;s Ranthambore National Park promises high chances of seeing a tiger. The fine bird sanctuary in Bharatpur holds the distinction of being a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Other good places to stay for bird watcher&rsquo;s are Gajner Palace (near Bikaner) and Chhatra Sagar (near Nimaj).
The vast majority of people in Rajasthan still live in rural areas. It is therefore a rewarding experience to stay in a village as it offers the perfect opportunity to experience rural life, interact with local communities, learn about the arts, crafts, culture and heritage of Rajasthan.
The accommodation in these villages can be in the form of converted mansions and hunting lodges as in the case of Bhenswara, Bijaipur, Chandelao, Jojawar, Khempur, Narlai and Rohet, or beautifully renovated forts such as at Barli, Khejarla, Pachewar and Luni. Each place has its own unique attractions, history, and village economy.

Pelling is a fast growing town which provides a good base for visiting the awe-inspiring ancient monastery of Pemayantse, one of the most important and revered monasteries in Sikkim.
Close to Pelling is the sacred Khechepori Lake, surrounded by lush forest cover. You can walk from here to the tiny hill town of Yuksom, a good base for treks or walks to nearby monasteries and jungles, with the mountains ever visible in the distance.
From Yuksom you can drive via the gold-topped Tashiding monastery to Ravangla, a sleepy Himalayan town overlooked by the Khanchenjunga range. Surrounded by high-forested hills and undulating valleys dotted with village huts Ravangla is an ideal place for short treks and bird watching.

Alternatively, we can arrange this for you when you get to India but in that case you require a stay in Darjeeling of a minimum of two days before going to Sikkim.

At Mamallapuram, barely an hour&rsquo;s drive from Chennai, the 7th-century complex of monolithic rock-cut shrines, and the legendary Shore Temple, are now a World Heritage Site. The stunning archeological remains co-exist with a long white sand beach, making Mamallapuram a favourite destination for travelers.
The coastal road from Mamallapuram leads to the former French colony of Pondicherry. There are some delightful small heritage hotels reflecting the French influence. Further south from Pondicherry is Tranquebar, a former Danish settlement, where you can stay in the Bungalow on the Beach. A perfect place to chill and relax.
From Tranquebar an inland road puts you back on the temple trail, leading to Chidambaram, Kumbakonam and Darasuram. The best bronzes and paintings can be found in Thanjavur, a city which boasts of almost a hundred temples including the monumental Brihadeshwari Temple, built entirely from granite.
The next major temple town is Tiruchirapalli. The Srirangam Temple in Trichy is probably the largest temple complex in India. It remains a functional temple with colourful bazaars in the first layer and Bhrahmins' houses in the second.
Moving southwards from Trichy you reach Karaikudi, the bastion of the Chettinads. and home to some of the most exquisite heritage homes which provide genuine home-cooked Chettinad food.
From Karaikudi, Madurai is just a two hour drive. Here you find the magnificent Meenakshi Temple complex whose soaring temple towers are covered with stucco figures of deities, mythical animals and monsters, painted in vivid colours.
In the west of the state, the hill stations of Kodaikanal, Coonoor and Ootacamund are the premier destinations. Verdant hills offer mountain views and a network of trails winds through forests and tea and coffee plantations.

    "content": 		"The northern state of Uttar Pradesh, popularly know as UP, is India&rsquo;s most populous state. It is the heartland of Hindi, the principal indigenous language of India, and the official language of government.
The plains of Uttar Pradesh have always been a fertile land, nourished by the Ganges and its tributaries. Here you find the famous Taj Mahal and other great monuments of the Moghul era in India, as well as the holy Hindu city of Varanasi and the Buddhist stupas of Sarnath.
The ethereal marble masterpiece that is the Taj Mahal in Agra is what first attracts tourists to Uttar Pradesh. Its perfect proportions and finely detailed pietra dura work leaves every single visitor spellbound. Agra&rsquo;s other monuments are often overshadowed by the glory of the Taj, but a trip to see the awe-inspiring red sandstone bastions of Agra Fort is worthwhile, not least for the views of the Taj Mahal in the distance.
Lucknow is the geographical and commercial centre of the state, but it still retains much of its colonial heritage. The crumbling remains of the British Residency mark the site of the decisive battle of the Mutiny of 1857, and buildings like the Bara and Chhota Imambura stand testimony to the opulent and grandiose lifestyles of the erstwhile Nawabs.
Further south of Lucknow is the other commercially important city of Allahabad. In the city&rsquo;s long 3000 year old history Allahabad has been significant for a variety of reasons. First and foremost as the site of the sangam (confluence) of 3 important Hindu rivers, later as an important Mughal stronghold and then during the Indian freedom struggle for the many political debates and meetings that were held in the Nehru residence of Anand Bhavan.
Downriver from Allahabad is the &ldquo;city of light&rdquo; - Varanasi. Built along the banks of the deified River Ganga are the colourful ghats that lead down to the water. Varanasi is considered the home of Shiva and therefore is filled with temples and small shrines. The river and the old city on it&rsquo;s western bank is best appreciated during the rituals of bathing and worship in the early mornings, and during the aarti ceremony at dusk.
Unchagaon is a small village off the Delhi-Moradabad highway. The narrow road that leads to it is covered with lush green on both sides. Unchagaon&rsquo;s claim to fame is its impressive early 18th century fort. The fort is tucked away, and nto easily visible unless you are standing right in front of the entrance.

    "content": 		"In the year 2000 the northern state of Uttaranchal was carved out of the hill areas of Uttar Pradesh. It is a small state filled to the brim with religious sites, wildlife reserves and cool hills that invite escape.
You can visit temples, ashrams and yoga centres at the holy cities of Haridwar and Rishikesh, float on a rubber raft along the Ganges, go on wildlife safaris in Corbett National Park, and follow trekking trails or relax in picturesque hill stations like Nainital and Ramgarh or Dehra Dun and Mussoorie.
From being a fairly isolated hill station famous only for the Indian equivalent to Eton, the Doon School, Dehra Dun has grown into a busy state capital with half a dozen schools, an army training institute and the wonderfully informative Forest Research Institute. It is best however, to enjoy Dehra Dun from the quiet of the hills that surround it, and the home-stay of Shaheen Bagh offers just that.
But the state is most famous for its sacred cities of Rishikesh and Haridwar. Colourful bazaars sell the flowers, powders and material required for the elaborate evening ceremonies that are performed in both cities. These cities were the focus for all those interested in Oriental philosophy and religion in the glory days of the 70&rsquo;s and even today they continue to weave their particular tantric magic on visitors.
Located in the hills above Dehra Dun, Mussoorie attracted the British for its salubrious climate. Mussoorie&rsquo;s restorative powers may have faded just that little bit but there are still charming corners to be found in the Tibetan settlement of Happy Valley and along the mist shrouded paths of Landour.
The other favourite hill station of the British Raj, Nainital also features many colonial buildings and Gothic churches. Nainital&rsquo;s famous lake is said to be the emerald green eye of goddess Sati, wife of Shiva. Today however, it&rsquo;s better known for it horse-riding and boating activities than its mythical importance.
Ramgarh and its surrounding areas are famous for their fruit orchards. Fruit grown here includes plums, peaches, pears and apples. Many writers and thinkers have been drawn to the beauty of Ramgarh and some of India&rsquo;s leading industrial families continue to own sprawling orchards.
Corbett National Park protects part of the wooded forests bordering the Shivalik Mountains in the south. It is home to over 100 tigers, 600 odd species of birds, wild elephants and a variety of deer. The varying vegetation and clear water rivulets of the park help to make Corbett is one of the most beautiful wildlife reserves in India.

    "content": 		"West Bengal is unique among Indian states as it stretches from the sea to the mountains.
To the south, the capital Kolkata dominates the political, economic and cultural life of much of eastern India.
The northern foothills of West Bengal&rsquo;s Himalaya are one of the greatest tea growing areas in the world. Here you find Raj-era hill stations such as the picturesque towns of Darjeeling and Kalimpong.
Starting from its humble origins as a village on the banks of the mighty Hooghly (as the Ganges is called here), to its rise to become one of the most important cities in the world, Kolkata (or Calcutta, as it is still referred to by many), was the capital of the British East India Company.
The British legacy is evident in the grand Victorian Gothic buildings, impressive churches and wide boulevards. Kolkata is also the centre of the awesome Bengali art and culture. Despite the squalor and the daunting number of its residents, Kolkata retains a majestic charm and is truly a window to the east of India.
A one hour flight to Bagdogra, or an overnight train to New Jalpaiguri, provides access to the spectacular mountain vistas of the north of the state. The nearest hill station is Kurseong, a quiet little town on the route of the Darjeeling Toy Train, and is home to world famous tea gardens.
You can take the toy train from Kurseong to Darjeeling. Here you can enjoy the atmosphere of the British Raj, the lush green tea plantations, the magnificent views of the Kanchenjunga and the colourful hill people of the north-eastern Himalayas.
Kalimpong is a few hours drive from Darjeeling, a very scenic route passing through rich forest, gigantic trees and tea gardens. Kalimpong is a wonderful centre for mountain viewing, bird watching, hill-walking, and visiting word famous flower nurseries. Kalimpong produces 80% of India&rsquo;s gladioli and is a significant orchid-growing area.
