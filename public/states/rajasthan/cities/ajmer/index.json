"content": <p>At the heart of predominantly Hindu Rajasthan is the Muslim city of Ajmer. This busy city is most famous for the shrine of the Sufi saint Mu&rsquo;inuddin Chishti who was instrumental in spreading Islam throughout northern India in the 12th century. The tomb (Dargah) is now a major pilgrimage place for Moslems, particularly during the annual commemoration of the saint&rsquo;s death.</p>
