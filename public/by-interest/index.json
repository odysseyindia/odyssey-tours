India provides something for everyone including our young travellers. Based on three decades of exploring this vast country, which included many family holidays of our own, we can plan a fully custom-built trip for you and your children.
There are hills to be climbed, forests to be explored, and lovely tented camps under desert stars and fairy-tale palaces to dream in. No matter what the age and interests of your family members, we can advice you on connecting rooms, walking the line between enough activity and sufficient downtime and general safety to ensure you have the perfect family holiday.

Stunning vistas of mountain ranges, rainforests, lazy canals with rowing boats, one of the world&rsquo;s largest coastlines - mile after mile of sandy beaches or smooth sand dunes stretching to the horizon; places that cannot be captured by the best panoramic camera, are all here.

Not so India, with her gigantic size and the different landscapes, where the monuments have a fabulous canvas. Right from pre-historic cave paintings to later arts, including the best of Islamic architecture, stunningly intricate Hindu and Jain temples, hilltop monasteries and white-washed churches of the Colonial era, India is a paradise for an art appreciator.

Islam came to India via the Arab traders who had a flourishing trade with the Malabar Coast, and Christianity came fairly soon after its inception to India, brought here by St Thomas, who is said to have landed in 52 AD at the Malabar Coast in Kerala. Each religion flourishes here and India is therefore the place to learn more about this mystic thing called religion.

India is the only country where you can see all the three big cats: lions, tigers and leopards. There is an enormous range of other wildlife too, including elephants, deer of all sizes, sturdy bison, sure-footed mountain goats and many more. The birdlife is staggering as well: the resident birds get annual guests from far-away lands, including Siberia!
