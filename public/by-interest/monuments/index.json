    "content": 		"The sheer number of noteworthy historical monuments in India is staggering. Any smaller country would have been almost over-burdened with so many. Not so India, with her gigantic size and the different landscapes, where the monuments have a fabulous canvas. Right from pre-historic cave paintings to later arts, including the best of Islamic architecture, stunningly intricate Hindu and Jain temples, hilltop monasteries and white-washed churches of the Colonial era, India is a paradise for an art appreciator.
