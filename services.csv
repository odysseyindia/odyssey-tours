Entering the Satra compound, one leaves behind one's footwear and hopefully one's arrogance. The monks, all males, live in simple and clean rooms, connected through long, common verandahs. The monks here are divided in small `families' of 3 - an older monk, a monk who is the bread winner and the youngest, the student. They live together in a small `boha', which is their family home.     At the centre of the Satra is the Naamghar - a prayer hall where monks gather to enact plays, music and dance. The satras are rich depositories of traditional Assamese arts and crafts, and regularly stage dance dramas in praise of Vishnu. Many of the monks have been invited to perform all over the country and even overseas. Watching one of the performances is a riveting experience.
