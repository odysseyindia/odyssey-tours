    "content": 		"The Taj Mahal is one of the most fascinating and beautiful monuments in the world. About 20,000 workers were employed in its construction, which took some 20 years. Agra&rsquo;s Red Fort, built in the form of a half moon on the Yamuna river, is a masterpiece of design. The fort&rsquo;s colossal walls are encircled by a moat and contain a maze of buildings, that form a small city within a city. You visit both on a half-day guided tour.
