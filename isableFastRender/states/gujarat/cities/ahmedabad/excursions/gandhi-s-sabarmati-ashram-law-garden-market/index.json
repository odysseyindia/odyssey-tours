    "content": 		"Alongside the Sabaramati River, the Ashram was the home of Mahatma Gandhi from 1915 to 1930, and the seeds of India&rsquo;s Independence campaign were sown here. His simple living quarters are maintained exactly as they were at that time. There is also a museum dedicated to his life.
The nearby Law Garden Market operates from late afternoon and has stalls selling colourful local fabrics, as well as a &ldquo;food street&rdquo; with local fast food outlets - the kulfi falooda is highly recommended at the end of a hot day.
