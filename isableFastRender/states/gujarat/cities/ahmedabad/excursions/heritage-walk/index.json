This is a fascinating maze of crowded bazaars, exquisitely carved facades, temples, subterranean stepwells, and even a secret passageway. You first walk through a Hindu dominated area, then a section dominated by Jains, then finally to the Muslim market area to end at the city&rsquo;s largest mosque.
