This sprawling building of wide sweeping arches and open courtyards houses simple, cosy rooms. Your host is a great source of stories about this traditional village, where he is the unofficial banker, court of appeal and general go-to man for anything the villagers need, just as in medieval times (including childbirth advice!).</p>
