The large house has just 4 rooms accessed from sunny corridors, a well-sized and quiet pool, and a grand lounge. Verandahs run almost the length of the house, and there are lovely, lazy nooks everywhere, and a restaurant with views of the sea and the lighthouse.

There is an open sitting area where you can relax and watch the world go by, sipping from a tender coconut and enjoying the sheer peace of the surroundings. Freshly cooked Indian food and chilled beer make the experience even more enjoyable.

Time can be spent watching the toddy tappers climbing the tall trees, walking among the paddy fields or along the river banks, or rowing through the narrow canals in a country boat.
