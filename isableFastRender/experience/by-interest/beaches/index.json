    "content": 		"Thousands of travellers visit India because it has the most diverse varieties of beaches anywhere in the world. Placid backwaters and lagoons, bays and rough lava-rocked seas, marine estuaries with fish, crashing surf, powdery golden sand or palm fringed shores - India has them all. The coastal areas of India have their own seafood cuisine, relaxing spas, diving and water sports - all are great settings for a balmy holiday.
